One such advancement is the uncovering of quantum computing. They are brought up to light for the purpose of solving problems and scenarios solved by classical computers but in a more effective way and at least a span of time. The study of quantum computing focuses on finding new ways to compute by utilizing quantum physics phenomena. A qubit, in contrast to a typical computer bit, can be either 0 or 1, or it can be a superposition of both 0 and 1. Quantum theory serving as the base to operate supercomputers is based on two aspects of quantum physics: superposition and entanglement. This quantum computing plays extraordinary roles in different zones of applications such as weather forecasting, logistics, finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

However the realization of a large-scale physical quantum computer is very challenging and the number of qubits that are currently under development is still very low, namely less than 15. In the absence of large size platforms, quantum computer simulation is critical for developing and testing quantum algorithms and investigating the different challenges facing the design of quantum computer hardware. What makes quantum computer simulation on classical computers particularly challenging are the memory and computational resource requirements. In this paper, we introduce a universal quantum computer simulator, called QX, that takes as input a specially designed quantum assembly language, called QASM, and provides, through agressive optimisations, high simulation speeds and large number of qubits. QX allows the simulation of up to 34 fully entangled qubits on a single node using less than 270 GB of memory. Our experiments using different quantum algorithms show that QX achieves significant simulation speedup over similar state-of-the-art simulation environment. ? 2017 IEEE.",QX: A high-performance quantum computer simulation platform,"Proceedings of the 2017 Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE 2017",Khammassi N.; Ashraf I.; Fu X.; Almudever C.G.; Bertels K.,language,o,,1,2024-02-18 16:50:07,

39872582,10.1103/PRXQuantum.3,0,,"We show that an array of polar molecules interacting with Rydberg atoms is a promising hybrid system for scalable quantum computation. Quantum information is stored in long-lived hyperfine or rotational states of molecules, which interact indirectly through resonant dipole-dipole interactions with Rydberg atoms. A two-qubit gate based on this interaction has a duration of 1?s and an achievable fidelity of 99.9%. The gate has little sensitivity to the motional states of the particles - the molecules can be in thermal states, the atoms do not need to be trapped during Rydberg excitation, the gate does not heat the molecules, and heating of the atoms has a negligible effect. Within a large, static array, the gate can be applied to arbitrary pairs of molecules separated by tens of micrometres, making the scheme highly scalable. The molecule-atom interaction can also be used for rapid qubit initialization and efficient, nondestructive qubit readout, without driving any molecular transitions. Single-qubit gates are driven using microwave pulses alone, exploiting the strong electric dipole transitions between rotational states. Thus, all operations required for large-scale quantum computation can be done without moving the molecules or exciting them out of their ground electronic states.  ? 2022 authors.

Herein, this approach is extended to multicomponent systems to enable the quantum mechanical treatment of more than one type of particle, such as electrons and positrons or electrons and nuclei, without invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Specifically, we introduce the multicomponent unitary coupled cluster (mcUCC) method combined with the VQE algorithm for the calculation of ground-state energies and wave functions as well as the multicomponent equation-of-motion (mcEOM) method for the calculation of excitation energies. These methods are developed within the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) framework and are formulated in the qubit basis to enable implementations on quantum computers. Moreover, these methods are used to calculate the ground-state energy and excitation energies of positronium hydride, where both electrons and the positron are treated quantum mechanically, as well as the H2 molecule, where both electrons and one proton are treated quantum mechanically. These applications validate the implementation and provide benchmark data for future calculations. The errors due to Trotterization of the mcUCC ansatz are also analyzed.

By viewing light as a multi-layered, symmetrical construct though, it is possible to interpret quantum-level dynamics assumed as fundamental, differently. Hence, looking at Schrodinger's Wave Equation and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle from the point of view of light, it becomes possible to understand quantum-level dynamics as an outcome of a multi-layered, symmetry-based model of light. Such a different view of quantum-level dynamics suggests a different way to conceive of quantum computation. As such, Schrodinger's Wave Equation can be viewed as an arbitration to take information from behind the quantum-veil that may exist in antecedent layers of light, and through such arbitration or rate of change of the wave-function, compute it into material existence. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle suggests that meta-level function seeking to precipitate or to be arbitrated into material existence may take different form while still fulfilling the intent of the meta-level function. Quantum computation, therefore, can be conceived as a creative as opposed to a solely constructive process. The object of quantum computation in such an interpretation of quantum phenomena is nothing other than to continue to create something new, or to continue to enhance materialization of meta-level function, rather than to simply construct based on regurgitating programming-based instruction. ? 2021 IEEE.",A light-based interpretation of schrodinger's wave equation and heisenberg's uncertainty principle with implications on quantum computation,"2021 IEEE International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, IEMTRONICS 2021 - Proceedings",Malik P.,,o,,-1,2024-02-18 17:22:56,

One of those algorithms is based on the maximum likelihood estimate with parallelized quantum circuits. In this paper, we extend this method so that it incorporates the realistic noise effect, and then give an experimental demonstration on a superconducting IBM Quantum device. The maximum likelihood estimator is constructed based on the model assuming the depolarization noise. We then formulate the problem as a two-parameters estimation problem with respect to the target amplitude parameter and the noise parameter. In particular we show that there exist anomalous target values, where the Fisher information matrix becomes degenerate and consequently the estimation error cannot be improved even by increasing the number of amplitude amplifications. The experimental demonstration shows that the proposed maximum likelihood estimator achieves quantum speedup in the number of queries, though the estimation error saturates due to the noise. This saturated value of estimation error is consistent to the theory, which implies the validity of the depolarization noise model and thereby enables us to predict the basic requirement on the hardware components (particularly the gate error) in quantum computers to realize the quantum speedup in the amplitude estimation task. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Amplitude estimation via maximum likelihood on noisy quantum computer,Quantum Information Processing,Tanaka T.; Suzuki Y.; Uno S.; Raymond R.; Onodera T.; Yamamoto N.,,o,,-1,2024-02-18 17:37:01,

Although quantum computing techniques have been available in the literature for the past 40 or more years, the desire for real-time implementation of such quantum computing techniques has become possible due to the ongoing superspeed development of quantum computers by multinational corporations. Albeit, only 40 qubits quantum computer has been developed to date. Still, the pathway of big corporations reveals that by the end of this decade, a full-fledged quantum computer will be available in the market for everyone. Quantum computing uses quantum key distribution for quantum communication. It is expected that quantum computing and quantum communication will completely change the workflow of many industries. Studies are also predicting that the market demand for the quantum computing industry will be in multi-trillion dollars as early as 2030. Besides, the perspective of researchers has been drastically changing due to the plethora of opportunities brought forth by quantum computing for data processing and data encryption tasks. The quantum computer is deep-rooted in uncertainty principle, and probability theories thereby prohibit the copying and replicating of quantum information. Consequently, the guarantee of unconditional security for transmitted data is ensured, otherwise impossible. Generally, transmitted data are hacked due to attackers? generation of keys replica.

With the correct choice of initial and final states, we show that the number of timesteps in QITE and QLanczos can be reduced significantly, which commensurately simplifies the required quantum circuit and improves compatibility with NISQ devices. We have performed these calculations on cloud-accessible IBM Q quantum computers. With the application of readout-error mitigation and Richardson error extrapolation, we have obtained ground and excited state energies that agree well with exact results obtained from diagonalization. ? 2020, The Author(s).",Practical quantum computation of chemical and nuclear energy levels using quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos algorithms,npj Quantum Information,Yeter-Aydeniz K.; Pooser R.C.; Siopsis G.,,o,,-1,2024-02-18 20:18:32,

Despite being built of the same fundamental computational unit, radically different approaches have emerged for characterizing the performance of qubits in gate-based and quantum annealing computers, limiting and complicating consistent cross-platform comparisons. To fill this gap, this work proposes a single-qubit protocol (Q-RBPN) for measuring some basic performance characteristics of individual qubits in both models of quantum computation. The proposed protocol scales to large quantum computers with thousands of qubits and provides insights into the distribution of qubit properties within a particular hardware device and across families of devices. The efficacy of the Q-RBPN protocol is demonstrated through the analysis of more than 300 gate-based qubits spanning eighteen machines and 2000 annealing-based qubits from one machine, revealing some unexpected differences in qubit performance.

Initial temperature measurements of linear Coulomb crystals containing barium and ytterbium ions indicate that the mass difference does not significantly impede sympathetic cooling of normal modes that couple well to the coolant ions (Ba in our case). Average motional occupation numbers are estimated to be 10 to 20 quanta per mode for these well cooled modes for chains with small numbers of ions, consistent with the Doppler limit temperature. For normal modes that do not couple significantly to the coolant atoms, the occupation numbers are significantly higher, of order several thousand.

If such a quantum computer is ever built, it would require built-in sources of nonclassical states required for various quantum information processing tasks. Possibilities of generation of such nonclassical states are investigated here for a physical system composed of a monochromatic light coupled to a two-band semiconductor with direct band gap. The model Hamiltonian includes both photon?exciton and exciton?exciton interactions. Time evolution of the relevant bosonic operators is obtained analytically by using a perturbative technique that provides operator solution for the coupled Heisenberg?s equations of motion corresponding to the system Hamiltonian. The bosonic operators are subsequently used to study the possibilities of observing single- and two-mode squeezing and antibunching after interaction in the relevant modes of light and semiconductor. Further, entanglement between the exciton and photon modes is reported. Finally, the nonclassical effects have been studied numerically for the open quantum system scenario. In this situation, the nonlocal correlations between two modes are shown to violate EPR steering inequality. The observed nonclassical features, induced due to exciton?exciton pair interaction, can be controlled by the phase of input field, and the correlations between two modes are shown to enhance due to nonclassicality in the input field. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Interaction of light and semiconductor can generate quantum states required for solid-state quantum computing: entangled, steered and other nonclassical states",Quantum Information Processing,Mukhopadhyay A.; Sen B.; Thapliyal K.; Mandal S.; Pathak A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-18 20:32:50,

Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk, especially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet reached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies are still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum programming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the established architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of abstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet software architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives, namely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off unnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally explore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks from the software implementation perspective. We find that for several specific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the problem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise description, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving framework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue, based on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between frameworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- A nd framework-specific portions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere hundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum programming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off unnecessary abstraction levels.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Peel | Pile?

Intuitively, randomized encoding {formula presented} of a function f is another function such that f(x) can be recovered from {formula presented}(x), and nothing except for f(x) is leaked from {formula presented}(x). Its quantum version, quantum randomized encoding, has been introduced recently [Brakerski and Yuen, arXiv:2006.01085]. Intuitively, quantum randomized encoding {formula presented}of a quantum operation F is another quantum operation such that, for any quantum state ?, F(?) can be recovered from {formula presented}(?), and nothing except for F(?) is leaked from {formula presented}(?).

One of the most important goals in the field of the verification of quantum computing is to construct a verification protocol with a verifier as classical as possible. This result therefore demonstrates a potential application of quantum randomized encoding to the verification of quantum computing: If we can find a good quantum randomized encoding (in terms of the encoding complexity), then we can construct a good verification protocol of quantum computing. We, however, also show that too good quantum randomized encoding is impossible: If quantum randomized encoding with a classical encoding operation is possible, then the no-cloning is violated.

39872647,10.1103/PRXQuantum.4,0,,"Logical gates constitute the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively studied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for (i) platform-independent logical gate definitions, (ii) flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis, and (iii) exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates holistically in a way that treats space and time on a similar footing. Focusing on instruments based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but platform-independent representations of topological logic gates - called logical blocks - and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, suggesting an alternative path toward LDPC-based quantum computation. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient software-based mapping from an abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical instructions for executing both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate set implemented with FBQC, and verify that the threshold for fault-tolerant gates is consistent with the bulk threshold for memory. We find, however, that boundaries, defects, and twists can significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rate suppression for boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer further resource reductions.  ? 2023 authors.

The second one is the X-SWAP scheme that enables inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated withcritical gates to reduce the SWAP overheads. Finally, we propose acompilation task scheduler, which dynamically selects concurrentquantum programs to be compiled and executed together basedon estimated fidelity for the best practice. We evaluate our workon publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulatedquantum chip IBMQ50.

39872664,10.23919/DATE.2019.8,0,,"The simulation of quantum computations basically boils down to the multiplication of vectors (describing the respective quantum state) and matrices (describing the respective quantum operations). However, since those matrices/vectors are exponential in size, most of the existing solutions (relying on arrays for their representation) are either limited to rather small quantum systems or require substantial hardware resources. To overcome these shortcomings, solutions based on decision diagrams (DD-based simulation) have been proposed recently. They exploit redundancies in quantum states as well as matrices and, by this, allow for a compact representation and manipulation. This offers further (unexpected) potential. In fact, simulation has been conducted thus far by applying one operation (i.e. one matrix-vector multiplication) after another. Besides that, there is the possibility to combine several operations (requiring a matrix-matrix multiplication) before applying them to a vector. But since, from a theoretical perspective, matrix-vector multiplication is significantly cheaper than matrix-matrix multiplication, the potential of this direction was rather limited thus far. In this work, we show that this changes when decision diagrams are employed. In fact, their more compact representation frequently makes matrix-matrix multiplication more beneficial - leading to substantial improvements by exploiting the combination of operations. Experimental results confirm the proposed strategies for combining operations lead to speed-ups of several factors or - when additionally exploiting further knowledge about the considered instance - even of several orders of magnitudes. ? 2019 EDAA.",Matrix-Vector vs. Matrix-Matrix Multiplication: Potential in DD-based Simulation of Quantum Computations,"Proceedings of the 2019 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, DATE 2019",Zulehner A.; Wille R.,,o,,-1,2024-02-18 23:20:33,

However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e., graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present.

The association step naturally leads to discrete optimization problems. As these optimization problems are often NP-hard, they can only be solved exactly for small instances on current hardware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) offers a solution for this, as it has the potential to provide a considerable speedup on a range of NP-hard optimization problems in the near future. However, current MOT formulations are unsuitable for quantum computing due to their scaling properties. In this work, we therefore propose the first MOT formulation designed to be solved with AQC. We employ an Ising model that represents the quantum mechanical system implemented on the AQC. We show that our approach is competitive compared with state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches, even when using of-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Finally, we demonstrate that our MOT problem is already solvable on the current generation of real quantum computers for small examples, and analyze the properties of the measured solutions. ? 2022 IEEE.",Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Multi Object Tracking,Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,Zaech J.-N.; Liniger A.; Danelljan M.; Dai D.; Van Gool L.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 0:56:06,

In order to resist attacks from ignoring identity authentication in BQC protocols, it is necessary to guarantee the legality of both clients and servers in a multi-party BQC network. So we propose a multi-party BQC protocol involving three phases to distribute shared keys and authenticate identities. Firstly, by using the advantages of measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), the registered client and the assigned server could share the initial key safely in registration phase. Secondly, with the help of semi-honest certificate authority (CA), mutual identity authentication phase realizes the two-way authentication from both sides through the shared key simultaneously. Thirdly, in the blind quantum computing phase, a registered client can complete his computing task by just measuring the qubits from the assigned server rather than preparing the qubits. Moreover, combined with first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, clients? authentication and blind quantum computing can be processed in parallel. The protocol can also be applied in other multi-party BQC protocols with the universality of resource states.

Based on a previously proposed CNOT model utilizing a quantum cloner (with a fidelity of 78 %), we present in this work our design of the Compact CNOT gate providing a fidelity of 90.31 %, and give physical realization constraints for building CNOT based decomposition of the Toffoli gate and more generalized photonic CnNOT gates.

In its general formulation, MAQA can be potentially adopted as the quantum counterpart of all those models falling into the scheme of aggregation of multiple functions, such as ensemble algorithms and neural networks. From a computational point of view, the proposed framework allows generating an exponentially large number of different transformations of the input at the cost of increasing the depth of the corresponding quantum circuit linearly. Thus, MAQA produces a model with substantial descriptive power to broaden the horizon of possible applications of quantum machine learning with a computational advantage over classical methods. As a second meaningful addition, we discuss the adoption of the proposed framework as hybrid quantum?classical and fault-tolerant quantum algorithm. ? 2023, The Author(s).",MAQA: a quantum framework for supervised learning,Quantum Information Processing,Macaluso A.; Klusch M.; Lodi S.; Sartori C.,,o,,1,2024-02-19 1:28:55,

Gene selection problem has a large number of genes (relevant, redundant or noise), which needs an effective method to help us in detecting diseases and cancer. In this problem, computational complexity is reduced by selecting a small number of genes, but it is necessary to choose the relevant genes to keep a high level of accuracy. Therefore, in order to find the optimal gene subset, it is essential to devise an effective exploration approach that can investigate a large number of possible gene subsets. In addition, it is required to use a powerful evaluation method to evaluate the relevance of these gene subsets. In this paper, we present a novel swarm intelligence algorithm for gene selection called quantum moth flame optimization algorithm (QMFOA), which based on hybridization between quantum computation and moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm. The purpose of QMFOA is to identify a small gene subset that can be used to classify samples with high accuracy. The QMFOA has a simple two-phase approach, the first phase is a pre-processing that uses to address the difficulty of high-dimensional data, which measure the redundancy and the relevance of the gene, in order to obtain the relevant gene set. The second phase is a hybridization among MFOA, quantum computing, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, etc., in order to solve the gene selection problem. We use quantum computing to guarantee a good trade-off between the exploration and the exploitation of the search space, while a new update moth operation using Hamming distance and Archimedes spiral allows an efficient exploration of all possible gene-subsets. The main objective of the second phase is to determine the best relevant gene subset of all genes obtained in the first phase. In order to assess the performance of the proposed QMFOA, we test QMFOA on thirteen microarray datasets (six binary-class and seven multi-class) to evaluate and compare the classification accuracy and the number of genes selected by the QMFOA against many recently published algorithms. Experimental results show that QMFOA provides greater classification accuracy and the ability to reduce the number of selected genes compared to the other algorithms. ? 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Hybridization of Moth flame optimization algorithm and quantum computing for gene selection in microarray data,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,Dabba A.; Tari A.; Meftali S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 1:29:32,

The most natural semantics for these logics is a form of holistic semantics, where meanings behave in a contextual way. In this framework, the concept of quantum probability can assume different forms. We distinguish an absolute concept of probability, based on the idea of quantum truth, from a relative concept of probability (a form of transition-probability, connected with the notion of fidelity between quantum states). Quantum information has brought about some intriguing epistemic situations. A typical example is represented by teleportation-experiments. In some previous works we have studied a quantum version of the epistemic operations 'to know', 'to believe', 'to understand'.

To prevent a violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another. However, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be implemented by LOBC with $\epsilon $ -error using ${O}(\log (1/\epsilon))$ entangled bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as ${O}(1/\epsilon)$. We also consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions ${d}_{A}\otimes {d}_{B}$. We find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of $\log {d}_{B}$ ebits is shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even when ${d}_{A}=2$. This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs of LOCC and LOBC gate implementation. Whereas previous lower bounds on the entanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum dimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement entropy. To our knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Bounds on Instantaneous Nonlocal Quantum Computation,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,Gonzales A.; Chitambar E.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 1:39:17,

However, DDF using distributions still is defined in terms of mathematical real-numbers (MRN), and do not address the Problem of Closure, here investigated. These facts lead to contradictions using MRN, solved by this work, providing a new unbounded class of physical solutions using physical numbers in quantum mechanics (QM), that were always there (just hidden), allowing DDF without distributions, or MRN. It is worthwhile to see this only in mathematics, to avoid the prejudices found in physics, as this reforms both general relativity and QM. This confirms the opinions of Nicolas Gisin that MRN are non-computable with probability 1, and Niels Bohr that physics is not reality, it is a fitting story about reality.

To achieve this goal, architectures that perform fault tolerance quantum computation (FTQC) with 3D cluster states have been designed; however, the current benchmarks for such constructions are still below general experimental requirements. In light of this, we propose a new 3D FTQC scheme by exploiting geometric tolerance to erasure errors using cluster states with novel lattice structures, specifically, by replacing the physical qubits with small-sized error detection codes that allow simple applications of logical CZ gates. We are able to locate Pauli errors locally and effectively convert them into loss errors. With a combination of code concatenation and multi-staged decoding, the scheme is able to achieve higher performance than traditional cubic lattices in protecting quantum information. We have surveyed a wide range of possible concatenation schemes and Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed on the decoders to study their respective scaling behavior. The scheme has demonstrated an overall decrement in active qubit overhead and an improvement of the error threshold, which varies from 10 % to 160% depending on the noise model, indicating a relatively higher rate of fault tolerance compared with previous cluster states-based codes.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Erasure Decoding Scheme of Topological Fault Tolerance Quantum Computation With 3D Concatenation Codes,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Li Z.; Kim I.; Hayden P.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 1:42:49,

It is quite natural to ask whether it is possible to eliminate intermediate measurements without increasing the number of ancillary qubits. We give an affirmative answer to this question by exhibiting a procedure to eliminate all intermediate measurements that is simultaneously space efficient and time efficient. In particular, this shows that the definition of a space-bounded quantum complexity class is robust to allowing or forbidding intermediate measurements.

Since it is so hard to break even for a computer, it becomes important to do encryption for all the secure transactions. Although it lies outside the capabilities of traditional computing, the recent developments in the field of quantum computing can be utilised to break RSA Encryption. The approach involves mapping of qubits used in a quantum machine to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and then using them to check for factors. This consists of the use of a Multiplicative Boolean circuit in which the qubits utilised by the machine replaces the variables. These Qubits are then mapped as per the gates involved, and the factorization problem is thus transformed into a CSP problem, through which, the factors can be easily found. Once known, these factors can be used to calculate the public and private keys effectively breaking the encryption security.

While quantum computers can be guarded against errors using error correction codes, near-term quantum computers will not have sufficient number of qubits to implement error correction and must perform their computation in the presence of errors. Qubit measurement is typically the most error-prone operation on a quantum computer, with measurement errors ranging from 8% to 30% reported on current machines. This goal of this paper is to mitigate measurement errors by exploiting the state-dependent bias of measurement errors. Experiments on the IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14 machines show variation in measurement errors depending on the state being measured. For example, measuring an all-zero state on IBM-Q5 has a fidelity of 84%; however, the fidelity drops to 62% while measuring the all-one state. To improve measurement fidelity, we propose Invert-and- Measure, which transforms the system from a vulnerable state to a stronger state and then performs the measurement in the stronger state. We propose two designs for Invert-and-Measure. First, Static Invert-and-Measure (SIM), which executes two instances of the program, one with standard measurements and the other with inverted measurements and combines the results. Second, Adaptive Invert and Measure (AIM), which learns the relative bias of different states using runtime profiling and produces specialized inversions to increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct answer. Our evaluations, using IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14, show that SIM improves the application reliability by up to 2X, and AIM by up to 3X. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Mitigating measurement errors in quantum computers by exploiting state-dependent bias,"Proceedings of the Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture, MICRO",Tannu S.S.; Qureshi M.K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 1:45:35,

Since then graph states, the generalization of the cluster state, were investigated and understood when they would enable such a measurement-based approach for quantum computation. Are there any other family of states, i.e., states with different entanglement structures, that can also serve as the universal resource for quantum computation? Recent study shows that the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states also provide a useful source. Here, we show that the spin-2 state on the square lattice is a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation. We employ a POVM on all sites that convert the local 5-level system to 2-level, and the post-POVM state is a graph state, whose graph is in general non-planar. We then follow with another round of measurement to recover the planarity of the graphs by thinning. The resultant typical graphs are shown to reside in the supercritical phase of percolation via Monte Carlo simulations and the associated graph states are universal, implying the AKLT state is also universal. ?

Runtime assertion is challenging in quantum computing for two key reasons. First, a quantum bit (qubit) cannot be copied, which is known as the non-cloning theorem. Second, when a qubit is measured, its superposition state collapses into a classical state, losing the inherent parallel information. In this paper, we overcome these challenges with runtime computation through ancilla qubits, which are used to indirectly collect the information of the qubits of interest. We design quantum circuits to assert classical states, entanglement, and superposition states.

However, making full use of the server?s quantum ability to reduce the client?s quantum cost is rarely acknowledged. In this research, we show that twice measurements on a three-qubits cluster state can be used to realize an indeterminate single-qubit gates by converting each qubit of the cluster state into another form in measurement-based quantum computation. In blind quantum computation, combining with this approach and adding different circuit-based quantum computation capabilities to the server, we present two models that the client can send fewer qubits to the server to implement a deterministic single-qubit gate. Finally, to keep the entire calculation process blind to the server, we substitute some bricks that realize a tensor of two single-qubit gates to the above models in the brickwork state. As a result, two types of the brickwork states with fewer particles were proposed, and we also give an upper bound for the number of replaced bricks. This reduces the quantum cost of the client. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",The brickwork state with fewer qubits in blind quantum computation,Quantum Information Processing,Yang Z.; Bai M.-Q.; Mo Z.-W.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:12:14,

We consequently obtain a scaling law for quantum information density for Steane code, concatenated codes, and surface code, which represent the quantum information equivalent of Moore?s law in terms of density scaling per node.

Previous work addresses the difficulty by utilizing multiple Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and multi-node computers. GPUs are efficient for handling runtime issues but have limited total accessible memory space. Meanwhile, the memory of a multi-node computer can be scaled to the petabytes order, but its bandwidth for access from host computers (CPUs) is narrow. To simultaneously accelerate simulation and enlarge the total memory space, we propose a heterogeneous parallelization approach by combining GPUs and CPUs. Our simulator allocates memory to the GPUs first, and then to the CPUs. It thus accelerates simulation by using the full capabilities of the GPUs if memory for the simulation fits in the GPUs on a cluster. Allocating memory to the CPUs reduces benefits of the GPUs but enlarges the capacity of qubits in the simulation. In such case, it can exploit the memory of the GPUs to add one more qubit in the simulation if the size of memory in a node is the power of two (such as 512GB).

By estimation, the frequency noise of 36.1 kHzrms can be achieved at 4 K, which almost meets the requirement of a quantum computer adopting Rabi oscillation of 10 MHz and pulsed microwave signal with a pulse duration of 50 ns for the gate operation.  ? 1993-2012 IEEE.",Design and Analysis of Sub-Sampling Phase-Locked Loop for Quantum Computing,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems,Chou Y.-J.; Chen H.-C.; Chang Y.-M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:12:25,

Two participant parties Alice and Bob, with the help of a semi-trusted third party and cloud device by simple quantum measurements and mathematical operation, can compare the equality of their secret information without revealing the content of secret information.

The diagrammatic language is generated by two kinds of nodes: the so-called ?spider? associated with the computational basis, as well as a new arity-N generalisation of the Hadamard gate, which satisfies a variation of the spider fusion law. Unlike previous graphical calculi, this admits compact encodings of non-linear classical functions. For example, the AND gate can be depicted as a diagram of just 2 generators, compared to ? 25 in the ZX-calculus. Consequently, N-controlled gates, hypergraph states, Hadamard+Toffoli circuits, and diagonal circuits at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy also enjoy encodings with low constant overhead. This suggests that this calculus will be significantly more convenient for reasoning about the interplay between classical non-linear behaviour (e.g. in an oracle) and purely quantum operations. After presenting the calculus, we will prove it is sound and complete for universal quantum computation by demonstrating the reduction of any diagram to an easily describable normal form. ? M.

Despite the implementation of such management infrastructures, incidents or security breaches happen. Each incident has associated a level of severity and a set of mitigation controls, so in order to restore the ISMS, the appropriate set of controls to mitigate their damage must be selected. The time in which the ISMS is restored is a critical aspect. In this sense, classic solutions are efficient in resolving scenarios with a moderate number of incidents in a reasonable time, but the response time increases exponentially as the number of incidents increases. This makes classical solutions unsuitable for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled and even less appropriate for scenarios in which security management is offered as a service to several companies. This paper proposes a solution to the incident response problem that acts in a minimal amount of time for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled. It applies quantum computing, as a novel approach that is being successfully applied to real problems, which allows us?to obtain solutions in a constant time regardless of the number of incidents handled.

Characterizing how close the simulation is and finding the optimal program state have been open questions for the past 20 years.

The basic units of computation are qubits, which are abstract objects with a mathematical expression to implement the quantum mechanics principles. Alongside quantum hardware, software is a principal element for conducting quantum computing. The software consists of logic gates and quantum circuits that implement algorithms for the execution of quantum programs. Due to those characteristics, quantum computing is a paradigm that non-physics experts cannot understand. Under this new scheme for developing software, it is important to integrate a conceptual framework of the fundamentals on which quantum computing is based. In this paper, we present a kind of taxonomical view of the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and the derived concepts that integrate the emerging discipline of quantum software engineering. We performed a quasi-systematic mapping for conducting the systematic review because the objective of the review only intends to detect the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and quantum software.

We implement two specific approaches, the exponential and separable NES, for parameter optimization of PQCs and compare them against standard gradient descent. We apply them to two different problems of ground state energy estimation using variational quantum eigensolver and state preparation with circuits of varying depth and length.

Many multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approaches have been widely studied. In a MAGDM problem, the multiple DMs are usually regarded as independent. However, in many practical situations, the opinions from different DMs are likely to influence each other or to be affected by the environment. To address it, a quantum framework based on quantum probability theory is proposed in this paper. The goal is to model the subjectivity in MAGDM when we have subjective beliefs towards DMs? independence or relations. The modeled subjectivity sources from the interference of beliefs. However, in classical models, subjectivity usually comes from the preference of DMs when determining weights or giving an evaluation towards alternatives. In this paper, the classical MAGDM technics are used to do the preparation firstly. Then a Bayesian network is constructed and it is extended to a quantum framework. The beliefs toward DMs are in a superposition. Namely, the opinions of DMs are viewed as various wave functions that are occurring at the same time. Then the beliefs will interfere with each and influence the final result. When all the DMs are deemed independent, the quantum framework will degenerate into a classical Bayesian network. The various cases of a simple example have been discussed and analyzed. A real supplier section problem is also used to illustrate and validate our model. Finally, an overall comparative analysis regarding the subjectivity in MAGDM is performed. ? 2018",A quantum framework for modelling subjectivity in multi-attribute group decision making,Computers and Industrial Engineering,He Z.; Chan F.T.S.; Jiang W.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:29:49,

In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented. Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP). Method: First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers. Results: The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC. Conclusion: By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier.

Here, we investigate and report digital simulations of Markovian, non-unitary dynamics that converge to a unique steady state. The steady state is programmed as a desired target state, yielding semblance to a quantum state preparation protocol. By delegating ancilla qubits and systems qubits, the system state is driven to the target state by repeatedly performing the following steps: (1) executing a designated system-ancilla entangling circuit, (2) measuring the ancilla qubits, and (3) re-initializing ancilla qubits to known states through active reset. While the ancilla qubits are measured and reinitialized to known states, the system qubits undergo a non-unitary evolution and are steered from arbitrary initial states to desired target states. We show results of the method by preparing arbitrary qubit states and qutrit (three-level) states on contemporary quantum computers. We also demonstrate that the state convergence can be accelerated by utilizing the readouts of the ancilla qubits to guide the protocol in a non-blind manner.

Since Shor's work, it has been known that the DLP can be solved by combining a polynomial-size quantum circuit and a polynomial-time classical postprocessing algorithm. The theoretical result corresponds the situation where a quantum device working with a medium number of qubits of very small errors can solve the DLP. However, all the quantum devices that we can use have a limited number of noisy qubits, as of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Thus, evaluating the instance size that the latest quantum device can solve and giving a future prediction of the size along the progress of quantum devices are emerging research topics. This article contains two proposals to discuss the performance of quantum devices against the DLP in the NISQ era: 1) a quantitative measure based on the success probability of the postprocessing algorithm to determine whether an experiment on a quantum device (or a classical simulator) succeeded; and 2) a procedure to modify bit strings observed from a Shor's circuit to increase the success probability of a lattice-based postprocessing algorithm. In this article, we conducted our experiments with the ibm_kawasaki device and discovered that the simplest circuit (7 qubits) from a 2-bit DLP instance achieves a sufficiently high success probability to proclaim the experiment successful. Experiments on another circuit from a slightly harder 2-bit DLP instance, on the other hand, did not succeed, and we determined that reducing the noise level by half is required to achieve a successful experiment. Finally, we give a near-term prediction based on required noise levels to solve some selected small DLPs and integer factoring instances.  ? 2020 IEEE.",The Present and Future of Discrete Logarithm Problems on Noisy Quantum Computers,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,Aono Y.; Liu S.; Tanaka T.; Uno S.; Meter R.V.A.N.; Shinohara N.; Nojima R.Y.O.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 13:47:51,

Here, we use quantum computing algorithms to quantify molecular vibrational energies and reaction pathways between CO2 and a simplified amine-based solvent model - NH3. Molecular vibrational properties are important to understanding kinetics of reactions. However, the molecule size correlates with the strength of anharmonicity effect on vibrational properties, which can be challenging to address using classical computing. Quantum computing can help enhance molecular vibrational calculations by including anharmonicity. We implement a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in a quantum simulator to calculate ground state vibrational energies of reactants and products of the CO2 and NH3 reaction. The VQE calculations yield ground vibrational energies of CO2 and NH3 with similar accuracy to classical computing.

The universal prior distribution for the automata is obtained as a quantum superposition, which is further conditioned to estimate the metrics. Specific cases are explored where the quantum implementation offers polynomial advantage, in contrast to the exhaustive enumeration needed in the corresponding classical case.

But, in certain situation, a member using right to veto may prefer to remain anonymous. This need leads to the requirement of the protocols for anonymous veto which can be viewed as a special type of voting. Recently, a few protocols for quantum anonymous veto have been designed which clearly show quantum advantages in ensuring anonymity of the veto. However, none of the efficient protocols for quantum anonymous veto have yet been experimentally realized. Here, we implement 2 of those protocols for quantum anonymous veto using an IBM quantum computer named IBMQ Manila and different quantum resources like Bell, GHZ and cluster states. In this set of proof-of-principle experiments, it is observed that using the present technology, a protocol for quantum anonymous veto can be realized experimentally if the number of parties who can veto remains small as in the case of UN council. Further, it is observed that Bell state-based protocol implemented here performs better than the GHZ/cluster state-based implementation of the other protocol in an ideal scenario as well as in presence of different types of noise (amplitude damping, phase damping, depolarizing and bit-flip noise). In addition, it is observed that based on diminishing impact on fidelity, different noise models studied here can be ordered in ascending order as phase damping, amplitude damping, depolarizing and bit-flip. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Experimental realization of quantum anonymous veto protocols using IBM quantum computer,Quantum Information Processing,Kumar S.; Pathak A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 1:55:01,

A content-addressable memory (CAM), which is an efficient memory cell structure for this purpose, in a quantum computing environment, is designed based on quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA). A CAM cell is composed of a memory unit that stores information, a match unit that performs a search, and a structure, using an XOR gate or an XNOR gate in the match unit, that shows good performance. In this study, we designed an XNOR gate with a multilayer structure based on electron interactions and proposed a QCA-based CAM cell using it.

Surprisingly, the basic mathematical structures of gate-based quantum computing, such as unitary operations on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, are not unique to quantum systems but may be found in certain classical systems as well. Previously, it has been shown that one can represent an arbitrary multi-qubit quantum state in terms of classical analog signals using nested quadrature amplitude modulated signals. Furthermore, using digitally controlled analog electronics one may manipulate these signals to perform quantum gate operations and thereby execute quantum algorithms. The computational capacity of a single signal is, however, limited by the required bandwidth, which scales exponentially with the number of qubits when represented using frequency-based encoding. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a method to extend this approach to multiple parallel signals. Doing so allows a larger quantum state to be emulated with the same gate time required for processing frequency-encoded signals. In the proposed representation, each doubling of the number of signals corresponds to an additional qubit in the spatial domain. Single quit gate operations are similarly extended so as to operate on qubits represented using either frequency-based or spatial encoding schemes. Furthermore, we describe a method to perform gate operations between pairs of qubits represented using frequency or spatial encoding or between frequency-based and spatially encoded qubits. Finally, we describe how this approach may be extended to represent qubits in the time domain as well. ? 2018 IEEE.",Parallel Quantum Computing Emulation,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing, ICRC 2018",La Cour B.R.; Lanham S.A.; Ostrove C.I.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:29:41,

Firstly, in qubits transmission between the server and the client, the loss of qubits is inevitable due to the channel noise. Thus, we propose a fault-tolerant framework for blind quantum computing using logical GHZ states over depolarization channels. In our protocol, an encoded GHZ state by 7-qubit Calderbank?Shor?Steane code is sent by the quantum channel as a medium of quantum teleportation. The client only makes a single-qubit measurement on the third qubit of the logical GHZ state, and the remaining Bell state is shared between the client and the server. After decoding logical Bell state, the client and the server perform the measurement-based blind quantum computing protocol. Secondly, there are two classes of collective noises in the channel, which will affect the blind quantum computing. We modify our BQC protocol to overcome the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotating noise with logical states | Hdp? , | Vdp? , | Hr? and | Vr?.

The security of these techniques requires a common secret key to be shared between the communicating entities or depend upon the premise that some mathematical problems are computationally hard. However, because of the open nature of the wireless medium, the communication cannot be kept confidential and is prone to eavesdropping. Furthermore, with the arrival of quantum computers, these techniques are prone to quantum attacks - the time complexity of the assumed hard problem gets reduced from millions of years to a few seconds.

In the first part of this procedure, the approximate self-energy of a molecular system is evaluated using a low-level method and subsequently a sparse Hamiltonian is found that best recovers this low-level dynamic self-energy. In the second step, such a sparse Hamiltonian is used by a high-level method that delivers a highly accurate dynamical part of the self-energy that is employed in later calculations. The tests conducted on small molecular problems show that the sparse Hamiltonian parameterizations lead to very good total energies. DSEM has the potential to be used as a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm for quantum computing where the sparse Hamiltonian containing only O(n2) terms on a Gaussian orbital basis, where n is the number of orbitals in the system, could reduce the depth of the quantum circuit by at least an order of magnitude when compared with simulations involving a full Hamiltonian. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.",Dynamical Self-energy Mapping (DSEM) for Creation of Sparse Hamiltonians Suitable for Quantum Computing,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,Dhawan D.; Metcalf M.; Zgid D.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:50:59,

In addition, the number of required qubits is 2N + 4cN, where N and c are the number of vertices and the maximal degree in the original computation graph, respectively.

The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling ?(?-1). As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase-estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the Fourier-filtering method developed in [Lin and Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared to ?. The relative-overlap condition is similar to a spectral-gap assumption but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around 2 orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under various settings.  ? 2023 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

Indeed this machine solves a spin glass problem with programmable coefficients but subject to quite strong topology restrictions on the set of non-zero coefficients. Rather than mapping problem variables onto multiple qbits, an approach which requires many invocations of the annealer to solve small size problems, it is tempting to investigate the existence of sparse relaxations compliant with the qbits interconnection topology of the machine, hence solvable in one invocation of the annealing oracle, but still providing goodquality solutions to the original problem. This paper provides an experimental setup which aims to determine whether or not such convenient relaxations do exist or, rather, are easy to find. Our experiments suggest that it is not the case and, therefore, that solving even moderate size arbitrary problems with a single call to a quantum annealer is not possible at least within the constraints of the so-called Chimera topology.

In this work, we present a tool to simulate the execution of fault-tolerant quantum computation by automating the tracking of common fault paths for error propagation through an encoded circuit block and quantifying the failure probability of each encoded qubit throughout the circuit. Our simulator runs a fault path counter on encoded circuit blocks to determine the probability that two or more errors remain on the encoded qubits after each block is executed, and it combines errors from all the encoded blocks to estimate performance metrics such as the logical qubit failure probability, the overall circuit failure probability, the number of qubits used, and the time required to run the overall circuit. Our technique efficiently estimates the upper bound of the error probability and provides a useful measure of the error threshold at low error probabilities where conventional Monte Carlo methods are ineffective.

Analogous to classical computer networks, quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing. Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network. ? 2021 IEEE.",A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in quantum networks,"Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2021",De Andrade M.G.; Dai W.; Guha S.; Towsley D.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:56:20,

Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed.

In this paper, we focus on preparing arbitrary spin eigenstates whose subset contains important entangled resources like Dicke states. Leveraging on the symmetry of these states, we consider uniform pairwise exchange coupling between every pair of qubits. Starting from a product state of a given spin eigenstate with a single-qubit state, another spin eigenstate can be prepared using simple time evolutions. This expansion paves a deterministic approach to prepare arbitrary Dicke states in linear steps. We discuss an improvement in this cost, building up on a previous work on deterministic preparation of W states in logarithmic circuit depth (Sharma and Tulapurkar in Phys Rev A 101:062330, 2020). The modified algorithm requires several iterations of pumping spin angular momentum into the system and is akin to the amplitude amplification in Grover?s search. To demonstrate the proposed scheme, we choose a system of non-interacting static spin qubits connected to a ferromagnetic reservoir. The flying qubits emerging from the reservoir locally interact with static qubits successively, mediating an in-direct exchange interaction between all the pairs. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Preparation of spin eigenstates including the Dicke states with generalized all-coupled interaction in a spintronic quantum computing architecture,Quantum Information Processing,Sharma A.; Tulapurkar A.A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:53:14,

Existing quantum compilers use intermediate representations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such IRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it is non-Trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the no-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce QSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables decades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum compilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The inputs and outputs of the operation are in one-To-one correspondence; qubits cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis pass that verifies no-cloning at compile-Time. The quantum circuit is fully encoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing optimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and dead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM Quantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably to IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure.

It introduces the notion of logic of the mind, whereby neurophysiological data are encoded as logical expressions representing mental activity. These representations then become instructions for BCI control. Long complex logical expressions are intractable for classical computers. Hence, a quantum computing algorithm is proposed. Despite the fact that quantum hardware for running the proposed algorithm is not yet available commercially, we provide a simulation, which demonstrates it plausibility. An attempt at running the system on a quantum computer is also detailed, accompanied with an explanation of current limitations.

In this contribution, we explore the possibility of extending the verifiable UBQC, to achieve further functionalities following the analogous research for classical circuits (Yao 1986). First, exploring the asymmetric nature of UBQC (the client preparing only single qubits, while the server runs the entire quantum computation), we present a ?Yao?-type protocol for secure two-party quantum computation. Similar to the classical setting, our quantum Yao protocol is secure against a specious (quantum honest-but-curious) garbler, but in our case, against a (fully) malicious evaluator. Unlike the previous work on quantum two-party computation of Dupuis et al., 2010, we do not require any online-quantum communication between the garbler and the evaluator and, thus, no extra cryptographic primitive.

We hope that this can motivate further research into hardware and system stability of quantum computers as well as into more-nuanced systems-level attacks. Although much work has been done on establishing error correcting codes to address issues of decoherence, and schemes can be utilized to leverage quantum effects for the sake of intrusion detection over quantum communication channels, there is a lack of literature in the field regarding side-channel attacks on transpiled quantum circuits, particularly those which leverage quantum effects to gather information about quantum circuits running in the cloud. We explored issues of decoherence by examining quantum circuit behavior both before and after a specified circuit was executed in order to ascertain decalibration rates and potential sources of decoherence: our data clearly shows that information on an interim circuit can be acquired in this manner. Using convenient data classification techniques and various circuit diagrams consisting of one quantum gate and several measurements, we were able to distinguish between these various circuits when executed at position n in the interim phase by training our classifier on data from probing circuits executed at queue positions n-1 and n+1. This shows that there is sufficient information residing in the data before and after a circuit is executed on a cloud-based superconducting quantum computer to allow an attacker to ascertain information about an otherwise unknown third-party circuit and shows potential to form the basis of a side-channel attack in cases where queue positions can be examined to target a third party's transpiled circuit during experimentation. This side channel attack merits further examination and extrapolation to identify more-complex circuits, and deeper statistical consideration to determine potential sources of information leakage and mitigation strategies.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Reconstructing quantum circuits through side-channel information on cloud-based superconducting quantum computers,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Bell B.; Trugler A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:11:46,

Ion placement is restricted to the vicinity of the rf null in order to minimise excess micromotion. Miniaturisation of trap geometries is desirable for increased ion density, but is at odds with the need to deliver high-voltage rf and tolerate the resulting power dissipation. We demonstrate a platform based on Penning traps, where ions are radially confined using a strong magnetic field. Static electric fields are then sufficient to provide confinement along the axis.

Furthermore, we show full quantum control of the spin and motion of the trapped ion. Ground state cooling of all motional modes is achieved and we measure the rate of motional heating due to electric field noise in the absence of an rf drive, obtaining noise levels below those observed in similar rf traps. Since only static fields are required for ion confinement, we can temporarily electrically isolate the trap electrodes from technical noise using switches, further reducing the observed electric field noise.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Demonstration of a micro-fabricated Penning trap for quantum computing,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",Sagesser T.; Jain S.; Hrmo P.; Kienzler D.; Home J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:16:57,

The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach captures these effects by treating selected nuclei quantum mechanically on the same footing as electrons. On classical computers, the resources required for an exact solution of NEO-based models grow exponentially with system size. By contrast, quantum computers offer a means of solving this problem with polynomial scaling. However, due to the limitations of current quantum devices, NEO simulations are confined to the smallest systems described by minimal basis sets, whereas realistic simulations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation require more sophisticated basis sets. For this purpose, we herein extend a hardware-efficient ADAPT-VQE method to the NEO framework in the frozen natural orbital (FNO) basis. We demonstrate on H2 and D2 molecules that the NEO-FNO-ADAPT-VQE method reduces the CNOT count by several orders of magnitude relative to the NEO unitary coupled cluster method with singles and doubles while maintaining the desired accuracy. This extreme reduction in the CNOT gate count is sufficient to permit practical computations employing the NEO method?an important step toward accurate simulations involving nonclassical nuclei and non-Born-Oppenheimer effects on near-term quantum devices.

Yet, current devices are limited by the number of qubits and suffer from significant imperfections, which prevents achieving quantum advantage. To step towards practical utility, one approach is to apply hardware-software co-design methods. This can involve tailoring problem formulations and algorithms to the quantum execution environment, but also entails the possibility of adapting physical properties of the QPU to specific applications. In this work, we follow the latter path, and investigate how key figures-circuit depth and gate count-required to solve four cornerstone NP-complete problems vary with tailored hardware properties.Our results reveal that achieving near-optimal performance and properties does not necessarily require optimal quantum hardware, but can be satisfied with much simpler structures that can potentially be realised for many hardware approaches. Using statistical analysis techniques, we additionally identify an underlying general model that applies to all subject problems. This suggests that our results may be universally applicable to other algorithms and problem domains, and tailored QPUs can find utility outside their initially envisaged problem domains.

Here, we put forward the first fully quantum simulation of dissipative collective phenomena on a real quantum computer, based on the recently introduced multipartite-collision model. First, we theoretically study the accuracy of this algorithm on near-term quantum computers with noisy gates and we derive some rigorous error bounds that depend on the time step of the collision model and on the gate errors. These bounds can be employed to estimate the necessary resources for the efficient quantum simulation of the collective dynamics. Then, we implement the algorithm on some IBM quantum computers to simulate superradiance and subradiance between a pair of qubits. Our experimental results successfully display the emergence of collective effects in the quantum simulation. In addition, we analyze the noise properties of the gates that we employ in the algorithm by means of full process tomography, with the aim of improving our understanding of the errors in the near-term devices that are currently accessible to worldwide researchers. We obtain the values of the average gate fidelity, unitarity, incoherence, and diamond error and we establish a connection between them and the accuracy of the experimentally simulated state. Moreover, we build a noise model based on the results of the process tomography for two-qubit gates and show that its performance is comparable with the noise model provided by IBM. Finally, we observe that the scaling of the error as a function of the number of gates is favorable, but at the same time reaching the threshold of the diamond errors for quantum fault-tolerant computation may still be orders of magnitude away in the devices that we employ.  ? 2023 authors.

For instance, the complexity of implementing the permutation of some given unitary transformations can be strictly decreased by allowing coherent control, rather than using the standard quantum circuit model. In this paper, we address the problem of optimising the resources of coherently controlled quantum computations. We refine the PBS-calculus, a graphical language for coherent control which is inspired by quantum optics. In order to obtain a more resource-sensitive language, it manipulates abstract gates - that can be interpreted as queries to an oracle - and more importantly, it avoids the representation of useless wires by allowing unsaturated polarising beam splitters. Technically the language forms a coloured PROP. The language is equipped with an equational theory that we show to be sound, complete, and minimal. Regarding resource optimisation, we introduce an efficient procedure to minimise the number of oracle queries of a given diagram. We also consider the problem of minimising both the number of oracle queries and the number of polarising beam splitters.

Thus, the US NIST is currently exploring new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are robust against quantum computers. Security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices?even with pre-quantum public-key cryptography?since IoT devices have tight energy constraints, limited computational power and strict memory limitations. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth investigation of the application of potential post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms (DSAs) proposed in the related US NIST process to a state-of-the-art, TLS-based, low-power IoT infrastructure. We implemented these new KEMs and DSAs in such a representative infrastructure and measured their impact on energy consumption, latency and memory requirements during TLS handshakes on an IoT edge device. Based on our investigations, we gained the following new insights. First, we show that the main contributor to high TLS handshake latency is the higher bandwidth requirement of post-quantum primitives rather than the cryptographic computation itself. Second, we demonstrate that a smart combination of multiple DSAs yields the most energy-, latency-and memory-efficient public key infrastructures, in contrast to NIST?s goal to standardize only one algorithm. Third, we show that code-based, isogeny-based and lattice-based algorithms can be implemented on a low-power IoT edge device based on an off-the-shelf Cortex M4 microcontroller while maintaining viable battery runtimes. This is contrary to much research that claims dedicated hardware accelerators are mandatory. ? 2022 by the authors.

Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal variations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC architectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological stabilizer codes.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Q3DE: A fault-tolerant quantum computer architecture for multi-bit burst errors by cosmic rays,"Proceedings of the Annual International Symposium on Microarchitecture, MICRO",Suzuki Y.; Sugiyama T.; Arai T.; Liao W.; Inoue K.; Tanimoto T.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 17:53:01,

In the age of digitalization and High-Tech applications, people are often not aware that temporal logic is deeply rooted in the philosophy of modalities. A deep understanding of these roots opens avenues to the modern calculi of temporal logic which have emerged by extension of modal logic with temporal operators. Computationally, temporal operators can be introduced in different formalisms with increasing complexity such as Basic Modal Logic (BML), Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL), Computation Tree Logic (CTL), and Full Computation Tree Logic (CTL*). Proof-theoretically, these formalisms of temporal logic can be interpreted by the sequent calculus of Gentzen, the tableau-based calculus, automata-based calculus, game-based calculus, and dialogue-based calculus with different advantages for different purposes, especially in computer science.

It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succint expression of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q#, a quantum-focused domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely express quantum algorithms.

Quantum simulation of the integrable system not only provides a valid benchmark for quantum computers but is also the first step in studying integrable-breaking systems. The building block for the simulation of an integrable system is the Yang?Baxter gate. It is vital to know how to optimally realize the Yang?Baxter gates on quantum computers. Based on the geometric picture of the Yang?Baxter gates, the optimal realizations of two types of Yang?Baxter gates with a minimal number of controlled NOT (CNOT) or (Formula presented.) gates are presented. It is also shown how to systematically realize the Yang?Baxter gates via the pulse control. The different realizations on IBM quantum computers are tested and compared. It is found that the pulse realizations of the Yang?Baxter gates always have a higher gate fidelity compared to the optimal CNOT or (Formula presented.) realizations.

To physically realize a 1WQC pattern, its qubits should be mapped onto a quantum physical environment. The nearest-neighbor architectures are suitable for implementing 1WQC patterns because they provide nearest-neighbor sufficient interactions for full entanglement that are necessary for highly entangled configuration of 1WQC. To make a 1WQC nearest-neighbor compliant, swap gates are needed to bring the interacting qubits of a gate adjacent. More swap gates result in the higher latency and error probability. Therefore, an efficient mapping of qubits of a 1WQC pattern onto qubits provided by a nearest-neighbor architecture can dramatically reduce the number of swaps. This motivates us to propose an approach that maps qubits of a 1WQC pattern to qubits of a two-dimensional nearest-neighbor architecture.

At the same time, the logical connectives are interpreted as quantum logical gates: unitary operators that process quantum information in a reversible way, giving rise to quantum circuits. Quantum computational logics have been mainly studied as sentential logics (whose alphabet consists of atomic sentences and of logical connectives). In this article we propose a semantic characterization for a first-order epistemic quantum computational logic, whose language can express sentences like 'Alice knows that everybody knows that she is pretty'. One can prove that (unlike the case of logical connectives) both quantifiers and epistemic operators cannot be generally represented as (reversible) quantum logical gates. The 'act of knowing' and the use of universal (or existential) assertions seem to involve some irreversible 'theoretic jumps', which are similar to quantum measurements.

We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X). ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Not All Qubits Are Created Equal: A Case for Variability-Aware Policies for NISQ-Era Quantum Computers,International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS,Tannu S.S.; Qureshi M.K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:39:45,

The method computes the order r of a random element x in the group Z?Nand uses that information for splitting N with an application of the greatest common divisor algorithm. However, being probabilistic, the success of Shor's algorithm relies on some special properties of N. If r is even and xr/2? -1 mod N, then gcd(xr/2- 1, N) reveals a nontrivial factor of N and the method succeeds. But even assuming that r is even and being given the complete prime factorization of N it is not obvious whether xr/2? -1 mod N and, therefore, it is not easy to assert whether Shor's algorithm would split N without running it and looking at its answer.

In this work, we derive the greatest lower bound for the gate error induced by a single application of a bosonic drive mode of given energy. Previously, such an error type has been considered to be inversely proportional to the total driving power, but we show that this limitation can be circumvented by introducing a qubit driving scheme which reuses and corrects drive pulses. Specifically, our method serves to reduce the average energy consumption per gate operation without increasing the average gate error.

Since the resulting optimization problem is in general nonconvex, the method can converge to suboptimal parameter values that do not yield the minimum eigenvalue. In this work, we address this shortcoming by adopting the concept of variational adiabatic quantum computing (VAQC) as a procedure to improve VQE. In VAQC, the ground state of a continuously parameterized Hamiltonian is approximated via a parameterized quantum circuit. We discuss some basic theory of VAQC to motivate the development of a hybrid quantum-classical homotopy continuation method. The proposed method has parallels with a predictor-corrector method for numerical integration of differential equations. While there are theoretical limitations to the procedure, we see in practice that VAQC can successfully find good initial circuit parameters to initialize VQE. We demonstrate this with two examples from quantum chemistry. Through these examples, we provide empirical evidence that VAQC, combined with other techniques (an adaptive termination criteria for the classical optimizer and a variance-based resampling method for the expectation evaluation), can provide more accurate solutions than 'plain'VQE, for the same amount of effort.  ? 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Improving the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Using Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing,ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing,Harwood S.M.; Trenev D.; Stober S.T.; Barkoutsos P.; Gujarati T.P.; Mostame S.; Greenberg D.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 15:00:33,

We developed a stable environment (ARM64) inside the robot (Raspberry) to run gradient operations and other quantum algorithms on IBMQ, Amazon Braket (D-Wave), and Pennylane locally or remotely. The proof of concept, when run in the above stated quantum environments, showed the execution time of our algorithm with different public access simulators on the market, computational results of our picking and batching algorithm, and analyze the quantum real-time execution.

The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover, our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators, i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.

This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's search algorithm. This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O(N), where N represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O(?-1 N/K), where ? is a relative error of measuring K. The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations.

Furthermore, gFlow has proven itself to be a powerful tool in studying the difference between the measurement-based and circuit models for quantum computing, as well as analysing cryptographic protocols. On the other hand, entanglement is known to play a crucial role in MBQC. In this paper we first show how gFlow can be used to directly give a bound on the classical simulation of an MBQC. Our method offers an interpretation of the gFlow as showing how information flows through a computation, giving rise to an information light cone.We then establish a link between entanglement and the existence of gFlow for a graph state. We show that the gFlow can be used to upper bound the entanglement width and what we call the structural entanglement of a graph state. In turn this gives another method relating the gFlow to upper bound on how efficiently a computation can be simulated classically.

However, the achievable fidelities are limited by the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states, as well as by technical imperfections such as atomic motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Rydberg-atom arrays using long-lived circular Rydberg states in optical traps. Based on the extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around 10-5 can be realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements, including a quantum-nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and robust dynamical-decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the current state of the art in quantum computing and simulation with neutral atoms. ? 2021 authors.

In order to fully harness the power of a general quantum computer or an application-specific device, compilers and tools must be developed that optimize specifications and map them to a realization on a specific architecture. In this work, a technique and prototype tool for synthesizing algorithms into a quantum computer is described and evaluated. Most recently reported methods produce technologically-independent reversible cascades comprised of a functionally complete set of operators with no regard to actual technologically-dependent cell libraries or constraints due to a device's pre-configured interconnectivity. In contrast, our prototype tool synthesizes algorithms into technologically-dependent specifications that consist of a set of primitives and connectivity constraints present in the computer architecture. The tool performs optimizations based on actual architectural constraints, and a high-quality technology-dependent synthesized result is achieved through the use of optimizing cost functions derived from real hardware and architecture parameters. Additionally, another important aspect of our tool is the incorporation of internal formal equivalence checking that ensures the initially specified algorithm is functionally equivalent to the optimized, technologically-mapped output.

Nevertheless, simulating quantum systems and analyzing quantum data has so far resisted an efficient classical treatment in full generality. While programmable quantum systems have been developed to address this challenge, the resources required for classically intractable problems still lie beyond our reach. In this work, we consider a new target for quantum-simulation algorithms; analyzing the data arising from physics experiments - specifically, muon-spectroscopy experiments. These experiments can be used to probe the quantum interactions present in condensed-matter systems. However, fully analyzing their results can require classical computational resources scaling exponentially with the simulated system size, which can limit our understanding of the studied system. We show that this task may be a natural fit for the coming generations of quantum computers. We use classical emulations of our quantum algorithm on systems of up to 29 qubits to analyze real experimental data, and to estimate both the near-term and error-corrected resources required for our proposal. We find that our algorithm exhibits good noise resilience, stemming from our desire to extract global parameters from a fitted curve, rather than targeting any individual data point. In some respects, our fault tolerant resource estimates go further than some prior work in quantum simulation, by estimating the resources required to solve a complete task, rather than just to run a given circuit. Taking the overhead of observable measurement and calculating multiple datapoints into account, we find that significant challenges still remain if our algorithm is to become practical for analyzing muon-spectroscopy data.  ? 2021 authors.

The most basic method to correct readout errors is matrix inversion, using a response matrix built from simple operations to probe the rate of transitions from known initial quantum states to readout outcomes. One challenge with inverting matrices with large off-diagonal components is that the results are sensitive to statistical fluctuations. This challenge is familiar to HEP, where prior-independent regularized matrix inversion techniques (?unfolding?) have been developed for years to correct for acceptance and detector effects, when performing differential cross section measurements.

The lower deco-herence time of the semiconductor charge-qubits as compared to their spin-qubit counterparts was mitigated by using a high frequency of control unit operation. This is facilitated by the co-integration on the same die of the semiconductor quantum structures together with their corresponding classic control circuitry. The main challenge of achieving deep cryogenic operation for the mixed-signal classic control circuit was surpassed by using programmable local heating DACs that slightly boost the local temperature of the control blocks above the average temperature of the die,which needs to be maintained around 4 K to enable a reliable quantum operation.

In quantum systems, noise and decoherence can degrade the coherence of quantum states, leading to errors and reduced computational accuracy. DD employs carefully designed sequences of control pulses to periodically intervene and counteract these undesired interactions, while DFS utilizes subspace encoding techniques to protect quantum information from decoherence. To evaluate and compare the fidelity achieved by DD and DFS, this paper presents a series of experiments considering the effect of time and the number of qubits. The experiments provide valuable insights into the performance of both methods under different conditions. By systematically examining the fidelity results, the impact of time and the scaling behavior with increasing qubits can be assessed. The experimental findings showcase the effectiveness of DD in reducing the impact of noise and extending the coherence time of quantum states. By strategically manipulating the quantum system, DD minimizes error accumulation and preserves the integrity of fragile quantum information. It is observed that the decrease in fidelity with increasing t is relatively small and gradual. Despite being outperformed by DD, the DFS method exhibits robustness and maintains a high degree of fidelity even in the presence of extended time durations.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Dynamical Decoupling (DD) to Improve Fidelity in Quantum Computing,"2023 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications, ICoDSA 2023",Ramadhani M.H.; Abdurohman M.; Nuha H.H.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:45:11,

This quantum algorithm achieves this result by modeling a fuzzy rule base with a quantum oracle, a black box that is widely used to estimate functions using quantum mechanical principles. Although QFIE offers the possibility of performing efficient fuzzy computation on quantum computers, its real-world applicability is limited by the high levels of noise still present in current quantum computers. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce technological arrangements to make QFIE fully functional in practical cases until noise-free quantum computers are released. This paper addresses this issue by designing a distributed version of QFIE, based on the D-NISQ reference model, to distribute the computation of subsets of fuzzy rules across multiple quantum processors and minimize the negative impact of quantum noise. Experimental results prove that this distributed version of QFIE is able to significantly improve the accuracy of fuzzy computation on quantum devices, making QFIE applicable in real-world scenarios. ? 2023 IEEE.",Distributing Fuzzy Inference Engines on Quantum Computers,IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems,Acampora G.; Massa A.; Schiattarella R.; Vitiello A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:07:38,
39873129,10.1038/s41534-019-0,0,,"Verifying quantum states is central to certifying the correct operation of various quantum information processing tasks. In particular, in measurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are generated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification protocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are particularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a single state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol currently known requires O(n15) copies of the state, where n is the size of the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more resource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires O(n5 log n) copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling?s bound, which is a probability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling?s bound also enables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph states. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is non-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph states that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit and continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the resource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de Finetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our protocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and therefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not increase the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling?s bound also makes our protocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph states. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Resource-efficient verification of quantum computing using Serfling?s bound,npj Quantum Information,Takeuchi Y.; Mantri A.; Morimae T.; Mizutani A.; Fitzsimons J.F.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:07:10,

In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques like surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we virtualize logical qubits by storing them in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon.Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal application of CNOT operations between logical qubits sharing the same physical address (same set of cavities) which are 6x faster than standard lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves approximately 10x in transmons with another 2x savings from an additional optimization for compactness.Although qubit virtualization pays a 10x penalty in serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and in area efficiency result in fault-tolerance and performance comparable to conventional 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show our system can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional two-dimensional grids while saving substantial hardware. Furthermore, our architecture can produce magic states at 1.22x the baseline rate given a fixed number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers as magic states are essential and machines will spend the majority of their resources continuously producing them.

To obtain reliable results in blind MBQC, it is crucial to verify whether the resource graph states are accurately prepared in the adversarial scenario. However, previous verification protocols for this task are too resource-consuming or noise-susceptible to be applied in practice. Here, we propose a robust and efficient protocol for verifying arbitrary graph states with any prime local dimension in the adversarial scenario, which leads to a robust and efficient protocol for verifying the resource state in blind MBQC. Our protocol requires only local Pauli measurements and is thus easy to realize with current technologies. Nevertheless, it can achieve optimal scaling behaviors with respect to the system size and the target precision as quantified by the infidelity and significance level, which has never been achieved before.

This paper shows that a similar result holds for space-bounded quantum computation with postselection. Namely, it is proved possible to eliminate intermediate postselections and measurements in the space-bounded quantum computation in the bounded-error setting. Our result strengthens the recent result by Le Gall, Nishimura and Yakaryilmaz [TQC 2021, pp.10:1- 10:17] that logarithmic-space bounded-error quantum computation with intermediate postselections and measurements is equivalent in computational power to logarithmic-space unbounded-error probabilistic computation. As an application, it is shown that bounded-error space-bounded one-clean qubit computation (DQC1) with postselection is equivalent in computational power to unbounded-error space-bounded probabilistic computation, and the computational supremacy of the bounded-error space-bounded DQC1 is interpreted in complexity-theoretic terms. ? 2022 Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing.

Therefore, detection and quantification of entanglement as well as preparation of highly entangled quantum states remain the fundamental objectives in these fields. Much attention has been devoted to the studies of graph states, which play a role of a central resource in quantum error correction, quantum cryptography and practical quantum metrology in the presence of noise.We examine multi-qubit graph states generated by the action of controlled phase shift operators on a separable quantum state of a system, in which all the qubits are in arbitrary identical states. Analytical expression is obtained for the geometric measure of entanglement of a qubit with other qubits in graph states represented by arbitrary graphs. We conclude that this quantity depends on the degree of the vertex corresponding to the qubit, the absolute values of the parameter of the phase shift gate and the parameter of the initial state the gate is acting on.

The only restriction is that not all CNOT gates are implemented and must be substituted with alternate sequences of gates. Each CNOT has its own mapping with a respective cost. However, by permuting the qubits, the number of CNOT that need mappings can be reduced. The problem is to find a good permutation without an exhaustive search. In this paperwe propose a solution for this problem. The permutation problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Solving the ILP problem, the lowest cost permutation for the CNOT mappings is guaranteed. To test and validated the proposed formulation, quantum architectures with 5 and 16 qubits were used. The ILP formulation along with mapping techniques found circuits with up to 64% fewer gates than other approaches. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Finding optimal qubit permutations for IBM's quantum computer architectures,"Proceedings - 32nd Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design, SBCCI 2019",De Almeida A.A.A.; Dueck G.W.; Da Silva A.C.R.,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 22:14:57,

Appropriate for both university students as well as software developers interested in programming a quantum computer, this practical approach to modern quantum computing takes the reader through the required background and up to the latest developments. Beginning with introductory chapters on the required math and quantum mechanics, Fundamentals of Quantum Computing proceeds to describe four leading qubit modalities and explains the core principles of quantum computing in detail. Providing a step-by-step derivation of math and source code, some of the well-known quantum algorithms are explained in simple ways so the reader can try them either on IBM Q or Microsoft QDK. The book also includes a chapter on adiabatic quantum computing and modern concepts such as topological quantum computing and surface codes. Features: Foundational chapters that build the necessary background on math and quantum mechanics. Examples and illustrations throughout provide a practical approach to quantum programming with end-of-chapter exercises. Detailed treatment on four leading qubit modalities -- trapped-ion, superconducting transmons, topological qubits, and quantum dots -- teaches how qubits work so that readers can understand how quantum computers work under the hood and devise efficient algorithms and error correction codes. Also introduces protected qubits - 0-p qubits, fluxon parity protected qubits, and charge-parity protected qubits. Principles of quantum computing, such as quantum superposition principle, quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, no-cloning theorem, quantum parallelism, and quantum interference are explained in detail. A dedicated chapter on quantum algorithm explores both oracle-based, and Quantum Fourier Transform-based algorithms in detail with step-by-step math and working code that runs on IBM QisKit and Microsoft QDK. Topics on EPR Paradox, Quantum Key Distribution protocols, Density Matrix formalism, and Stabilizer formalism are intriguing.

Since the chosen two codes have different sets of transversal gates, we can implement a universal set of gates transversally, thereby reducing the overall cost. We use code teleportation to convert between quantum states in different codes. The overall cost is decreased if code teleportation requires fewer resources than the fault-tolerant implementation of the non-transversal gate in a specific code. To analyze the cost reduction, we investigate two cases with different base codes, namely the Steane and Bacon-Shor codes. For the Steane code, neither the proposed dual-code model nor another variation of it achieves any cost reduction since the conventional approach is simple. For the Bacon-Shor code, the three proposed variations of the dual-code model reduce the overall cost. However, as the encoding level increases, the cost reduction decreases and becomes negative. Therefore, the proposed dual-code model is advantageous only when the encoding level is low and the cost of the non-transversal gate is relatively high. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Dual-code quantum computation model,Quantum Information Processing,Choi B.-S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 14:05:30,

In this article, we evaluate the performance of modern system-on-chip (SoC) architectures in meeting the control demands associated with performing quantum gates on trapped-ion qubits, particularly focusing on communication within the SoC. A principal focus of this article is the data transfer latency and throughput of several high-speed on-chip mechanisms on Xilinx multiprocessor SoCs, including those that utilize direct memory access (DMA). They are measured and evaluated to determine an upper bound on the time required to reconfigure a gate parameter. Worst-case and average-case bandwidth requirements for a custom gate sequencer core are compared with the experimental results. The lowest variability, highest throughput data-transfer mechanism is DMA between the real-time processing unit (RPU) and the programmable logic, where bandwidths up to 19.2 GB/s are possible. For context, this enables the reconfiguration of qubit gates in less than 2 ?s, comparable to the fastest gate time.

Forecast models are designed with two to five qubits, which represent 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-day historical data respectively. Ising model's real-valued weights and dimensionless coefficients are calculated using daily mean air temperatures from 119 places around the world as well as sea level (Aburatsu, Japan). In comparison with current methods, this approach is better suited to predict the heat wave values because it does not require the estimation of a probability distribution from scarce observations. The proposed forecast quantum computing algorithm is simulated based on traditional computer architecture and combinatorial optimization of Ising model parameters for the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport dataset with 1-day lead-time on learning sample (1975-2010 yr). Analysis of the forecast accuracy (ratio of successful predictions to total number of predictions) on the validation sample (2011-2014 yr) shows that Ising model with three qubits has 100% accuracy, which is significant as compared to other methods. However, number of identified heat waves is small (only one out of nineteen in this case). Other models with 2, 4, and 5 qubits have 20%, 3.8%, and 3.8% accuracy respectively.

Such Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can produce incorrect output as the computation is subjected to errors. The applications on a NISQ machine try to infer the correct output by running the same program thousands of times and logging the output. If the error rates are low and the errors are not correlated, then the correct answer can be inferred as the one appearing with the highest frequency. Unfortunately, quantum computers are subjected to correlated errors, which can cause an incorrect answer to appear more frequently than the correct answer. We observe that recent work on qubit mapping (including the recent work on variation-aware mapping) tries to obtain the best possible qubit allocation and uses it for all the trials. This approach significantly increases the vulnerability to correlated errors - if the mapping becomes susceptible to a particular form of error, then all the trials will get subjected to the same error, which can cause the same wrong answer to appear as the output for a significant fraction of the trials. To mitigate the vulnerability to such correlated errors, this paper leverages the concept of diversity and proposes an Ensemble of Diverse Mappings (EDM). EDM uses diversity in qubit allocation to run copies of an input program with a diverse set of mappings, thus steering the trials towards making different mistakes. By combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, EDM amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect answers.

With O(?/?) repetitions of these circuits one can use phase estimation to sample in the molecular eigenbasis, where ? is the 1-norm of Hamiltonian coefficients and ? is the target precision. This is the lowest complexity shown for quantum computations of chemistry within an arbitrary basis. Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors, this matches the scaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can work only with orthogonal-basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane-wave dual basis). Our key insight is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a method known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to transform the Coulomb operator into an isospectral diagonal form with a nonorthogonal basis defined by the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the nonorthogonal THC Hamiltonian, in a fashion that avoids most complications of the nonorthogonal basis. We also reanalyze and reduce the cost of several of the best prior algorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear comparison to the present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling space-time volume, compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules such as FeMoCo reveals that our method requires the least fault-tolerant resources of any known approach. By laying out and optimizing the surface-code resources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated using about four million physical qubits and under 4 days of runtime, assuming 1-?s cycle times and physical gate-error rates no worse than 0.1%. ? 2021 authors.

However, existing quantum programming environments mostly require an in-depth understanding of the basic QC building blocks, that is, quantum states, superposition, entanglement and measurement as well as the changing of quantum states using basic quantum gates. The present state of quantum programming reminds us of how Classical Computing was about 70 years ago when computing machines such as the ENIAC required significant effort to program solely using very basic digital building blocks. Over the decades, though, increasingly higher-level abstractions have been created on top of the basic building blocks of Classical Computing and made computation much more accessible and wide-spread. In order to make Quantum Computing more accessible, we argue that Software Engineering for QC needs to embark on a similar journey and create abstractions that shield developers from the basic QC building blocks as much as possible so that they can focus their attention on solving problems and less on how to manipulate quantum states using quantum circuits. Based on our experience of developing a scalable quantum n-queens solver, this paper aims to formulate recommendations for raising the level of abstraction in Quantum Software Engineering.  ? 2022 ACM.",Towards Higher-Level Abstractions for Quantum Computing,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,Cobb A.; Schneider J.-G.; Lee K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:48:25,

A common approach is to prepare a trial ground state on the quantum computer and measure observables such as energy, but this is often limited by hardware constraints that prevent an accurate description of the target ground state. The quantum computed moments (QCM) method has proven to be remarkably useful in estimating the ground state energy of a system by computing Hamiltonian moments with respect to a suboptimal or noisy trial state. In this paper, we extend the QCM method to estimate arbitrary ground state observables of quantum systems. We present preliminary results of using QCM to determine the ground state magnetisation and spin-spin correlations of the Heisenberg model in its various forms. Our findings validate the well-established advantage of QCM over existing methods in handling suboptimal trial states and noise, extend its applicability to the estimation of more general ground state properties, and demonstrate its practical potential for solving a wide range of problems on near-term quantum hardware. ? 2023 IEEE.",Arbitrary Ground State Observables from Quantum Computed Moments,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",Vallury H.J.; Hollenberg L.C.L.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:38:47,

To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. That is, it allows a large set of different physical operations to be realized on the qubits, based on the input angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time.Studying this tradeoff is challenging because of the diversity in QC application requirements, the need to optimize applications for widely different hardware gate types and noise variations across gate types. Therefore, our work develops NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several vendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has potential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC systems.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Designing calibration and expressivity-efficient instruction sets for quantum computing,Proceedings - International Symposium on Computer Architecture,Lao L.; Murali P.; Martonosi M.; Browne D.,,o,,1,2024-02-21 15:01:48,

In this scheme, the nuclei in a molecule are treated as classical point charges while the electrons are treated as quantum mechanical particles. The electronic states and candidate geometries are encoded as a superposition of many-qubit states, for which a histogram created from repeated measurements gives the global minimum of the energy surface. We demonstrate that the circuit depth per step scales as O(ne2poly(logne)) for the electron number n e, which can be reduced to O(nepoly (logne)) if extra O(nelogne) qubits are available. Moreover, resource estimation implies that the total computational time of our scheme starting from a good initial guess may exhibit overall quantum advantage in molecule size and candidate number. The proposed scheme is corroborated using numerical simulations. Additionally, a scheme adapted to variational calculations is examined that prioritizes saving circuit depths for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

In sharp contrast, the picture of concurrently secure MPC (or even 2PC), for both classical and quantum functionalities, still remains unclear. Quantum information behaves in a fundamentally different way, making the job of adversaries harder and easier at the same time. Thus, it is unclear if the positive or negative results from the classical setting still apply. This work initiates a systematic study of concurrent secure computation in the quantum setting. We obtain a mix of positive and negative results. We first show that assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions (PQ-OWFs), concurrently secure 2PC (and thus MPC) for quantum functionalities is impossible. Next, we focus on the bounded-concurrent setting, where we obtain simulation-sound zero-knowledge arguments for both NP and QMA, assuming PQ-OWFs. This is obtained by a new design of simulation-sound gadget, relying on the recent post-quantum non-malleable commitments by Liang, Pandey, and Yamakawa [arXiv:2207.05861], and the quantum rewinding strategy recently developed by Ananth, Chung, and La Placa [CRYPTO?21] for bounded-concurrent post-quantum ZK.

Recently, the first quantum fuzzy inference engine (QFIE) has been proposed to evaluate fuzzy rules in parallel on quantum computers, whose design hardware is based on different technologies such as superconductors, photonics, trap-ion, cold atoms, and so on. Although the theoretical potential of this approach is very promising, its practical usage is still limited by the current quantum hardware, in term of dimension and noise. This paper attempts to bridge this theoretical/practical gap and pave the way for the execution of fuzzy rule-based systems on real quantum hardware by presenting a comparative study between two of the most promising quantum computing platforms, superconducting and trap-ion devices. The comparison is carried out by using QFIE for the control of a simulated particle accelerator system inspired by a real facility at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

A stuck-at fault is mostly addressed in circuits. We need good test patterns that trigger the defects to test the stuck-at marks. In large combinational circuits, the search space for test patterns grows exponentially with the number of inputs. Therefore an efficient test pattern generation technique is needed.

The previously introduced RBM embedding that combined qubits into individual RBM units in order to increase the connectivity between units was used. In comparison to the 1000 qubit machine investigated earlier, the same embedding approach applied to the 2000 qubit D-Wave enabled a connectivity between RBM units sufficient for RBM training on a classical computer with a satisfactory classification error. After a varied number of CD training iterations, the visible units corresponding to a particular incomplete test image were fixed in the D-Wave embedding.

Unfortunately, physical quantum devices are highly susceptible to errors that limit us from running most of these quantum applications. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are required to implement Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQC) on which computations can be performed without encountering errors. Error decoding is a critical component of quantum error correction and is responsible for transforming a set of qubit measurements generated by the QEC code, called the syndrome, into error locations and error types. For the feasibility of implementation, error decoders must not only identify errors with high accuracy, but also be fast and scalable to a large number of qubits. Unfortunately, most of the prior works on error decoding have focused primarily only on the accuracy and have relied on software implementations that are too slow to be of practical use. Furthermore, these studies only look at designing a single decoder and do not analyze the challenges involved in scaling the storage and bandwidth requirements when performing error correction in large systems with thousands of qubits.In this paper, we present AFS, an accurate, fast, and scalable decoder architecture that is designed to operate in the context of systems with hundreds of logical qubits. We present the hardware implementation of AFS, which is based on the Union Find decoding algorithm and employs a three-stage pipelined design. AFS provides orders of magnitude higher accuracy compared to recent SFQ-based hardware decoders (logical error rate of 6?10-10 for physical error rate of 10-3) and low decoding latency (42ns on average), while being robust to measurement errors introduced while extracting syndromes during the QEC cycles. We also reduce the amount of decoding hardware required to perform QEC simultaneously on all the logical qubits by co-designing the micro-architecture across multiple decoding units. Our proposed Conjoined-Decoder Architecture (CDA) reduces the storage overhead by 70% (10MB to 2.8MB). Finally, we reduce the bandwidth overheads required to transmit syndromes from the qubits to the decoders by exploiting the sparsity in the syndromes and compressing the data. Our proposed Syndrome Compression reduces the bandwidth requirement by 30x, on an average.  ? 2022 IEEE.","AFS: Accurate, Fast, and Scalable Error-Decoding for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers",Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture,Das P.; Pattison C.A.; Manne S.; Carmean D.M.; Svore K.M.; Qureshi M.; Delfosse N.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:11:46,

In this spirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of nearterm quantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to implement 'Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC):' By approximating fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume (qubits ? gates, or 'Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)') of near-term machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program [58].Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical quantum bit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of typical, contemporary quantum system designs. Under a pure dephasing error model, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term machines. The decoder achieves a 5% accuracy threshold as well as pseudo-thresholds of approximately 5%, 4.75%, 4.5%, and 3.5% physical error rates for code distances 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. Decoding solutions are achieved in a maximum of $\sim$20 nanoseconds on the largest code distances studied. By avoiding the exponential idle time in offline decoders, we achieve a 10x reduction in required code distances to achieve the same logical performance as alternative designs. ? 2020 IEEE.",NISQ+: Boosting quantum computing power by approximating quantum error correction,Proceedings - International Symposium on Computer Architecture,Holmes A.; Jokar M.R.; Pasandi G.; Ding Y.; Pedram M.; Chong F.T.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 17:43:50,

The choice of a two-qubit (2Q) hardware basis gate depends on a quantum modulator?s native Hamiltonian interactions and applied control drives. In this paper, we propose a collaborative design approach to select the best ratio of drive parameters that determine the best basis gate for a particular modulator. This requires considering the theoretical computing power of the gate along with the practical speed limit of that gate, given the modulator drive parameters. The practical speed limit arises from the couplers? tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied, for which some combinations can result in higher overall speed limits than others. Moreover, as this 2Q basis gate is typically applied multiple times in succession, interleaved by 1Q gates applied directly to the qubits, the speed of the 1Q gates can become a limiting factor for the quantum circuit, particularly as the pulse length of the 2Q basis gate is optimized. We propose parallel-drive to drive the modulator and qubits simultaneously, allowing a richer capability of the 2Q basis gate and in some cases for this 1Q drive time to be absorbed entirely into the 2Q operation. This allows increasingly short duration 2Q gates to be more practical while mitigating a significant source of overhead in some quantum systems. On average, this approach can decrease circuit duration by 17.8% and decrease infidelity for random 2Q gates by 10.5% compared to the currently best reported basic 2Q gate, ?iSWAP. ? 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The efforts by companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft to construct quantum computers have been making headlines for years. Equally important is the challenge of translating problems into a state that can be fed to these machines. Because quantum computers are in essence controllable quantum systems, the problems that most naturally map to them are those of quantum mechanics. Quantum chemistry has seen particular success in the form of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, which is used to determine the ground state energy of molecular systems. The goal of our work has been to use the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics to translate other systems so that they can be run through this same algorithm. We describe two ways of accomplishing this using a position basis approach and a Gaussian basis approach. We use this translation to compute finite temperature quantities such as the average energy as a function of temperature. We do this by constructing a 0+1 dimensional thermal field theory, constructing a thermal double of the system and using tensor products to construct operators in the system coupled to a heat bath. We also discuss how to include a chemical potential in the quantum computations. We then connect the 0+1 formalism to gauge theory by using an effective matrix model description used in nuclear theory. We study effective potentials for components of the gauge field and use the VQE algorithm to calculate the ground state energies.

We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized single and double excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only single and double excitations (UCCSD). k-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of O(kN), compared with O(N3) for UCCGSD, and O((N-?)2?) for UCCSD, where N is the number of spin orbitals and ? is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ans?tze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H                             4                              (STO-3G, 6-31G), H                             2                             O (STO-3G), and N                             2                              (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that k-UpCCGSD offers a good trade-off between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. UCCGSD is also found to be more accurate than UCCSD but at a greater cost for implementation. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states.

This prototype container based system allows single user and small project groups to do rapid prototype development, testing and implementation of extreme capability algorithms with more agility and flexibility than can be provided through the IBM Q Experience website. This prototype environment also provides an excellent teaching environment for labs and project assignments within graduate courses in cloud computing and quantum computing.

The analysis and design of the next generation of software architectures must address the new requirements to accommodate the Internet of things (IoT), cybersecurity, blockchain networks, cloud, and quantum computer technologies. As 5G wireless increasingly establishes itself over the next few years, moving legacy applications into these new architectures will be critical for companies to compete in a consumer-driven and social media-based economy. Few organizations, however, understand the challenges and complexities of moving from a central database legacy architecture to a ledger and networked environment. The challenge is not limited to just designing new software applications. Indeed, the next generation needs to function more independently on various devices, and on more diverse and wireless-centric networks. Furthermore, databases must be broken down into linked list-based blockchain architectures, which will involve analytic decisions regarding which portions of data and metadata will be processed within the chain, and which ones will be dependent on cloud systems. Finally, the collection of all data throughout these vast networks will need to be aggregated and used for predictive analysis across a variety of competitive business applications in a secured environment. Certainly not an easy task for any analyst/designer! Many organizations will continue to use packaged products and open-source applications. These third-party products will need to be integrated into the new architecture paradigms and have seamless data aggregation capabilities, while maintaining the necessary cyber compliances. The book also clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved, including the IT departments, users, executive sponsors, and third-party vendors. The book?s structure also provides a step-by-step method to help ensure a higher rate of success in the context of re-engineering existing applications and databases, as well as selecting third-party products, conversion methods and cybercontrols.

Trapped ion systems typically use strong radio-frequency (r.f.) fields for confinement, which present a technological challenge in delivering the required power to miniaturized surface traps with a two-dimensional geometry. Such a geometry is desired for scaling in a large information process but is fundamentally at odds with the fact that any ions straying away from one-dimensional r.f. nulls suffer excess micromotion. We instead envision a two-dimensional array of Penning traps that will operate free from the detrimental strong r.f. fields: a repeating pattern of dc electrodes on a microfabricated trap chip with static quadrupole potentials will create an axial confinement at each trap site and in combination with a strong and homogenous magnetic field generate radial confinement. Each individual trap site would then host a single ion and would be easily reconfigurable to adjust the distance to a neighboring site to allow for tunable coupling strengths. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we built an experimental apparatus that houses a micro-fabricated trap capable of creating two radially separated trapping wells inside a cryogenic vacuum chamber inserted into the bore of a 3 T superconducting magnet. We report on the first successful loading of 9Be+ ions into the trap. The results highlight our ability to successfully cool the radial motion using the radial motional mode coupling technique known as axialization.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Microfabricated Penning trap for quantum computation and simulation,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Hrmo P.; Jain S.; Sagesser T.; Kienzler D.; Home J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:34:46,

From another perspective, when the achievable code distance is up to about 11, our scheme allows executing 103 times more logical operations.

This framework is simultaneously general enough to encompass many counting problems on graphs and specific enough to allow the derivation of dichotomy results, partitioning all problems into those which are in FP and those which are #P-hard. The Holant framework is based on the theory of holographic algorithms, which was originally inspired by concepts from quantum computation, but this connection appears not to have been explored before. Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results in a concise way and to derive a dichotomy for a new family of problems, which we call Holant+. This family sits in between the known families of Holant?, for which a full dichotomy is known, and Holantc, for which only a restricted dichotomy is known. Using knowledge from entanglement theory - both previously existing work and new results of our own - we prove a full dichotomy theorem for Holant+, which is very similar to the restricted Holantc dichotomy and may thus be a stepping stone to a full dichotomy for that family. ?

One barrier is the software engineering of quantum programs, which can be approached from two directions. On the one hand, many software engineering practices, debugging in particular, are bound to classical computing. On the other hand, quantum programming is closely associated with the phenomena of quantum physics, and consequently, the way we express programs resembles the early days of programming. Moreover, much of the software engineering research today focuses on agile development, where computing cycles are cheap and new software can be rapidly deployed and tested, whereas in the quantum context, executions may consume lots of energy, and test runs may require lots of work to interpret. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by starting with the quantum computing workflow and by mapping existing software engineering research to this workflow.

In this work, we present an overview of various noise sources and their impact on the resilience and the security of quantum circuits.

Social networks analysis (SNA) and quantum probability theory (QPT) are combined to construct a decision framework considering superposition and interference effects in SN-GDM scenarios.

We identify symmetry interference terms from Shapley value and asymmetry interference terms from trust value, respectively. The probability of an alternative is calculated through quantum probability theory in our influence diagram. The combination of QLBN model and social network could gain an understanding of how the group preferences evolve within SN-GDM scenarios, and provide new insights into SNA.

Even when the gates used to perform these operations are noisy, the quantum computation must be tolerable to the errors.

Previous quantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g., quantum amplitude and phase estimation) require error rates that are too low for near-term implementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available quantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum devices, reducing the measurement number and runtime compared to the standard sampling method of the VQE. Our scheme derives inspiration from quantum metrology, phase estimation, and the more recent 'alpha-VQE'proposal, arriving at a general formulation that is robust to error and does not require ancilla qubits.

So it seems that, the additional driving Hamiltonian plays an important role in adiabatic computing. In this paper, we show five kinds of possible forms of the driving Hamiltonian, and analyses the performance of the algorithms. We find that the former fourth kinds of driving Hamiltonian may still cause the adiabatic algorithm lose their efficiency when the overlap of the initial and final states equals some special value. More importantly, we find that only the final kinds of the driving Hamiltonian can be extended. By modifying its interpolating functions, the final kind of adiabatic algorithm can suit any fidelity of the systems to keep the adiabatic evolution always be valid.

This work highlights that the existing reset operations available in superconducting qubit NISQ quantum computers are not fully secure. In particular, this work demonstrates for the first time a new type of higher-energy state attack. Although NISQ quantum computers are typically abstracted as working with only energy states |0? and |1?, this work shows that it is possible for unprivileged users to set the qubit state to |2? or |3?. By breaking the abstraction of a two-level system, the new higher-energy state attack can be deployed to affect the operation of circuits or for covert communication between circuits. This work shows that common reset protocols are ineffective in resetting a qubit from a higher-energy state. To provide a defense, this work proposes a new Cascading Secure Reset (CSR) operation. CSR, without hardware modifications, is able to efficiently and reliably reset higher-energy states back to |0?. CSR achieves a reduction in |3?-initialized state leakage channel capacity by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, and does so with a 25x speedup compared with the default decoherence reset. ? 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Securing NISQ Quantum Computer Reset Operations Against Higher-Energy State Attacks,CCS 2023 - Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,Xu C.; Mi A.; Chen J.; Szefer J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 18:01:12,

It is well known that intermediate quantum measurements can be deferred to the end of the computation, resulting in an equivalent purely unitary computation. While time efficient, this transformation blows up the space to linear in the running time, which could be super-polynomial for low-space algorithms. Fefferman and Remscrim (STOC'21) and Girish, Raz and Zhan (ICALP'21) show different transformations which are space efficient, but blow up the running time by a factor that is exponential in the space. This leaves the case of algorithms with small-but-super-logarithmic space as incurring a large blowup in either time or space complexity.

We find that TILT can substantially reduce communication as compared with comparable-sized Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures. We also develop two important scheduling heuristics for TILT. The first heuristic reduces the number of swap operations by matching data traveling in opposite directions into an 'opposing swap.', and also avoids the maximum swap distance across the width of the head, as maximum swap distances make scheduling multiple swaps in one head position difficult. The second heuristic minimizes ion chain motion by scheduling the tape to the position with the maximal executable operations for every movement. We provide application performance results from our simulation, which suggest that TILT can outperform QCCD in a range of NISQ applications in terms of success rate (up to 4.35x and 1.95x on average).

For delegated computation protocols to be usable in a larger context ? or simply to securely run two protocols in parallel ? the security definitions need to be composable. Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness ? the computation is hidden from the server ? and those that are also verifiable ? the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct ?trace-distance-type? criteria ? which are, individually, non-composable security definitions. Additionally, we study the security of some known delegated quantum computation protocols, including Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi?s Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol. Even though these protocols were originally proposed with insufficient security criteria, they turn out to still be secure given the stronger composable definitions. ?

One way to answer the question is to find those algorithms, but finding truly quantum algorithms turns out to be very difficult. In previous work, over the past three decades, we have pursued the idea of using techniques of machine learning to develop algorithms for quantum computing. Here, we compare the performance of standard real- and complex-valued classical neural networks with that of one of our models for a quantum neural network, on both classical problems and on an archetypal quantum problem: the computation of an entanglement witness.

It demands ultra-low temperature and high vacuum. Practicality and scaling up thus remain questionable. This work analyzes the alternative based on the micro- and nanoparticles of the compounds of Rare Earth (RE) elements, such as phosphors NaYF4: X3+ (X stands for Tm, Er, etc.), embedded in polymer matrices. The qubits in these systems correspond to the quantum levels of 4f electrons of RE ions, and they have optical frequencies. Qubit formation is supported by the properties of RE ions: (a) weak interaction with the environment, (b) strong inhomogeneous crystal field, and (c) the ability of neighboring ions, being in some 4f states, to interact with each other through the mechanism of Stark blockade. The latter is required for quantum conditional gate operations, such as Controlled NOT (CNOT - the basic block of a quantum computer circuit). Optical spectroscopy indicated that CNOT gate can be implemented, for instance, using the transitions in for-level system of Tm3+ ions |3H6> (ground state), |3H4> (state 0), |1D2> (state 1), and |1I6> (auxiliary state 1') activated with conventional tunable lasers at 451, 653, 798, and 1459 nm. We also considered the PT- and anti-PT-symmetry on the decoherence rate of the qubits. PT-symmetric Hamiltonian H(x) has its real part symmetric versus x-coordinate, and the anti-PT-symmetric one is anti-symmetric. Anti-PT symmetric qubits tend to be more decoherence stable than the others. It was suggested that the anti-PT-symmetry can be introduce via coupling of the qubits to anti-PT-symmetric cavities using RE-doped compounds as gain media. ? 2021 Copyright SPIE.",Quantum computers based on rare-earth compounds and PT-and anti-PT symmetric qubits,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,Patel D.N.; Sarkisov S.S.; Darwish A.M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:01:13,

The probabilistic distribution is closely related to the sample size, and there exist more or fewer interference effects among different individual opinions. Thus, this article develops a quantum framework for modeling interference effects in the linguistic distribution MCGDM process. First, considering the sample size information, we redefine the LDAs and provide a new computational model for them. Second, to integrate a series of LDAs, the linguistic distribution weighted averaging (LDWA) operator is presented. Mathematic proofs reveal that the new LDWA operator can not only ensure the information integrality but also can avoid the conjunctive and disjunctive operations. Third, to explore the interference effects among individual opinions, a quantum framework is constructed. In this process, individual opinions are viewed as various wave functions occurring synchronously. They interfere with each and influence the aggregation result. Finally, an illustrative example of Internet finance soft power evaluation is provided to verify the effectiveness.

Recently, quantum software engineering (QSE) becomes an emerging area attracting more and more attention. However, it is not clear what are the challenges and opportunities of quantum computing facing the software engineering community. This work aims to understand the QSE-related challenges perceived by developers. We perform an empirical study on Stack Exchange forums where developers post-QSE-related questions answers and Github issue reports where developers raise QSE-related issues in practical quantum computing projects. Based on an existing taxonomy of question types on Stack Overflow, we first perform a qualitative analysis of the types of QSE-related questions asked on Stack Exchange forums. We then use automated topic modeling to uncover the topics in QSE-related Stack Exchange posts and GitHub issue reports. Our study highlights some particularly challenging areas of QSE that are different from that of traditional software engineering, such as explaining the theory behind quantum computing code, interpreting quantum program outputs, and bridging the knowledge gap between quantum computing and classical computing, as well as their associated opportunities.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Understanding Quantum Software Engineering Challenges An Empirical Study on Stack Exchange Forums and GitHub Issues,"Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2021",El Aoun M.R.; Li H.; Khomh F.; Openja M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:29:12,

In this paper, we present the optimized implementation of binary field inversion in quantum circuits. Reversible and non-reversible multiplication circuits are finely combined to reduce the number of CNOT gate. In particular, we optimized the reversible circuit for A? B and A?

Lastly, the-state-of-art multiplication and squaring implementation techniques, such as Karatsuba algorithm and shift-based squaring are utilized to obtain the optimal performance. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed implementation, the inversion is applied to the substitute layer of AES block cipher.

It is a more accurate cost measure for algorithms that have infrequent spikes in memory usage and are run in environments such as cloud computing that allow dynamic allocation and de-allocation of resources during execution, or when many multiple instances of an algorithm are interleaved in parallel. We prove the first lower bounds on cumulative memory complexity for both sequential classical computation and quantum circuits. Moreover, we develop general paradigms for bounding cumulative memory complexity inspired by the standard paradigms for proving time-space tradeoff lower bounds that can only lower bound the maximum space used during an execution. The resulting lower bounds on cumulative memory that we obtain are just as strong as the best time-space tradeoff lower bounds, which are very often known to be tight. Although previous results for pebbling and random oracle models have yielded time-space tradeoff lower bounds larger than the cumulative memory complexity, our results show that in general computational models such separations cannot follow from known lower bound techniques and are not true for many functions. Among many possible applications of our general methods, we show that any classical sorting algorithm with success probability at least 1/poly(n) requires cumulative memory ??(n2), any classical matrix multiplication algorithm requires cumulative memory ?(n6/T), any quantum sorting circuit requires cumulative memory ?(n3/T), and any quantum circuit that finds k disjoint collisions in a random function requires cumulative memory ?(k3n/T2). ?

Here we address how temporal and spatial variations in noise relate device reliability to quantum computing stability. First, our approach quantifies the differences in statistical distributions of characterization metrics collected at different times and locations using Hellinger distance. We then validate an analytical bound that relates this distance directly to the stability of a computed expectation value. Our demonstration uses numerical simulations with models informed by the washington superconducting transmon device. We find that the stability metric is consistently bounded from above by the corresponding Hellinger distance, which can be cast as a specified tolerance level.

Multi-tenancy has a promise of allowing better utilization of the quantum computer hardware, but also opens up the quantum computer to new types of security attacks. As this and other recent research shows, it is possible to perform a fault injection attack using crosstalk on quantum computers when a victim and attacker circuits are instantiated as co-tenants on the same quantum computer. To ensure such attacks do not happen, this paper proposes that new techniques should be developed to help catch malicious circuits before they are loaded onto quantum computer hardware.

We concatenate the topological quantum error-correction code with three-qubit repetition codes and estimate that our architecture can tolerate a remarkably high photon-loss rate of 11.5%; this makes a drastic change that is at least an order higher than those of known proposals. Furthermore, considering three-photon GHZ states as resources, we estimate the resource overheads to perform gate operations with an accuracy of 10-6(10-15) to be 2.07?106(5.03?107). Compared to other all-photonic schemes, our architecture is also resource efficient. In addition, the resource overhead can be even further improved if larger GHZ states are available.

Alternatively, photons are well decoupled from the environment and have advantages of speed and timing for quantum computing. Photonic systems have already demonstrated capability for solving specific intractable problems like Boson sampling, but face challenges for practically scalable universal quantum computing solutions because it is extremely difficult for a single photon to ?talk? to another deterministically. Here, a universal distributed quantum computing scheme based on photons and atomic-ensemble-based quantum memories is proposed. Taking the established photonic advantages, two-qubit nonlinear interaction is mediated by converting photonic qubits into quantum memory states and employing Rydberg blockade for the controlled gate operation. Spatial and temporal scalability of this scheme is demonstrated further. These results show photon-atom network hybrid approach can be a potential solution to universal distributed quantum?computing. ? 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Distributed Quantum Computing with Photons and Atomic Memories,Advanced Quantum Technologies,Oh E.; Lai X.; Wen J.; Du S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:47:39,

Generally, many-qubit entangled states are often used to complete BQC tasks. But for a large-scale entangled state, it is difficult to be described since its Hilbert space dimension is increasing exponentially. Furthermore, the number of entangled qubits is limited in experiment of existing works. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a universal BQC protocol based on measurement with minor resources, where the trap technology is adopted to verify correctness of the server?s measurement outcomes during computation and testing process. In our model, there are two participants, a client who prepares initial single-qubit states and a server that performs universal quantum computation. The client is almost classical since she does not require any quantum computational power, quantum memory. To realize the client?s universal BQC, we construct an m? n latticed state composed of six-qubit cluster states and eight-qubit cluster states, which needs less qubits than the brickwork state.

In particular, state vector simulators, which store a full state vector in memory and update it in every quantum operation, can be used to simulate an arbitrary form of quantum circuits, debug quantum applications, and validate future quantum computers. Since the time and space complexity grows exponentially with the number of qubits and easily exceeds the capability of a single machine, various distributed state vector simulators are developed. However, these are tuned for common CPUs and GPUs, not for ARM CPUs. Therefore, we develop a distributed state vector simulator, mpiQulacs, that is optimized for large-scale simulation on A64FX-based cluster systems. A64FX is a 48-core ARM-based CPU having high-bandwidth memory (HBM2) and also used in one of the world's top supercomputers, Fugaku. As computational optimization, we vectorize qubit operations with Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) to fully utilize its HBM2. To reduce the amount of inter-node communication for scalable simulation, mpiQulacs provides a fused-swap gate that collectively performs multiple swap operations as one operation and a quantum circuit optimizer that automatically adds fused-swap gates to a circuit. We evaluate weak and strong scaling of mpiQulacs with up to 39 qubits on our 512-node A64FX-based cluster system. The result shows that mpiQulacs achieves high-scalability on hundreds of nodes in benchmark and practical quantum circuits, and its performance is comparable with the existing well-known distributed state vector simulators. ? 2023 IEEE.",mpiQulacs: A Scalable Distributed Quantum Computer Simulator for ARM-based Clusters,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",Tabuchi A.; Imamura S.; Yamazaki M.; Honda T.; Kasagi A.; Nakao H.; Fukumoto N.; Nakashima K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 17:38:41,

Quantum modular multipliers have the potential to have a significant impact in a range of fields, including cryptography and beyond, since they offer a faster and more efficient way to do modular multiplications. Several fields, including simulation, optimization, and cryptography, can benefit from the use of quantum computing.One of the crucial operations in many of these applications is modular multiplication, a sort of multiplication that requires obtaining the remainder of the product of two numbers when divided by a third number. In this paper, we provide a novel modular multiplication method based on a quantum algorithm. To examine its complexity and compare it to that of current adders, we employ a novel form of adder that is intended to not retain the final carry.

In order to execute corresponding quantum algorithms (usually provided in terms of quantum circuits), certain physical constraints in the architectures need to be satisfied. More precisely, physical constraints restrict the possible interactions between qubits which frequently result in cases where qubits which are supposed to interact in a quantum circuit are not allowed to interact on the physical device. Thus far, this is addressed by dedicated methods that map the logical quantum circuit to a physical realization and satisfy the constraints by inserting further operations. This leads to additional costs which harm the fidelity of the circuit and, hence, urgently need to be avoided. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art approaches for this mapping process take the existing architectures as invariant and only try to reduce the number of additionally needed operations. In contrast, (slight) changes in the, respectively, given architectures (which still keep the underlying physical constraints satisfied) might be possible and may allow for even better (i.e., less costly) mappings. But this potential has not been investigated yet. In this work, we explore this potential. More precisely, we introduce several schemes for generating alternative coupling graphs (and, by this, quantum computing architectures) that still might be able to satisfy physical constraints but, at the same time, allow for a more efficient realization of the desired quantum functionality. Evaluations confirm the potential of those alternative coupling graphs and demonstrate that they can reduce the mapping overhead by up to 60% in the best case and up to almost 40% on average. ? 1982-2012 IEEE.",Exploring the Potential Benefits of Alternative Quantum Computing Architectures,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,Deb A.; Dueck G.W.; Wille R.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:06:58,

However, the state-of-the-art Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers still do not have enough qubits to accommodate the error correction circuit. Noise in quantum gates limits the reliability of quantum circuits. To characterize the noise effects, prior methods such as process tomography, gateset tomography and randomized benchmarking have been proposed. However, the challenge is that these methods do not scale well with the number of qubits. Noise models based on the understanding of underneath physics have also been proposed to study different kinds of noise in quantum computers. The difficulty is that there is no widely accepted noise model that incorporates all different kinds of errors. The realworld errors can be very complicated and it remains an active area of research to produce accurate noise models. In this paper, instead of using noise models to estimate the reliability, which is measured with success rates or inference strength, we treat the NISQ quantum computer as a black box. We use several quantum circuit characteristics such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, the number of CNOT gates, and the connection topology of the quantum computer as inputs to the black box and derive a reliability estimation model using (1) polynomial fitting and (2) a shallow neural network.

Orthogonal to existing QC simulation optimizations, we aim to accelerate the simulation by eliminating the redundant computation among those Monte Carlo simulation trials. We observe that the intermediate states of many trials can often be the same. Once these states are computed in one trial, they can be temporarily stored and reused in other trials. However, storing such states will consume significant memory space. To leverage the shared intermediate states without introducing too much storage overhead, we propose to statically generate and analyze the Monte Carlo simulation simulation trials before the actual simulation. Those trials are reordered to maximize the overlapped computation between two consecutive trials. The states that cannot be reused in follow-up simulation are dropped, so that we only need to store a few states. Experiment results show that the proposed optimization scheme can save on average 80% computation with only a small number of state vectors stored. In addition, the proposed simulation scheme demonstrates great scalability as more computation can be saved with more simulation trials or on future QC devices with reduced error rates. ? 2020 IEEE.",Eliminating redundant computation in noisy quantum computing simulation,Proceedings - Design Automation Conference,Li G.; Ding Y.; Xie Y.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:53:52,

Qubits, the basic unit of quantum computing have the power to exist in more than one state at a time. While the classical computers only perform operations by manipulation of classical bits having two values 0 and 1, quantum bits can represent data in multiple states. This property of inheriting multiple states at a time is called superposition which gives quantum computers tremendous power over classical computers. With this power, the algorithms designed on quantum computers to solve search queries can yield result significantly faster than the classical algorithms. There are four types of problems that exist: Polynomial (P), Non-Deterministic Polynomial (NP), Non-Deterministic Polynomial Complete (NP-complete) and Non-Deterministic Polynomial hard (NP-hard). P problems can be solved in the polynomial amount of time like searching a database for an item. However, when the size of the search space grows, it becomes difficult to compute solutions even for P problems. Quantum algorithms like Grover?s algorithm has reduced the time complexity of some of the classical algorithm problems from N to N. Variants of Grover?s algorithm like Quantum Partial Search propose changes that yield not exact but closer results in time even lesser than Grover?s algorithm. NP problems are the problems whose solution if known can be verified in polynomial amount time. Factorization of prime numbers which is considered to be an NP problem took an exponential amount of time when solved using the classical computer while the Shor?s quantum computing algorithm computes it in polynomial time. Factorization is also a class of bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) problems which are decision problems solved by quantum computers in polynomial time. There are problems to which if a solution is found can solve every problem Of NP class, these are NP-complete problems. The power of Qubits could be exploited in the future to come up with solutions for NP-complete problems in the future. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Quantum Computer Search Algorithms: Can We Outperform the Classical Search Algorithms?,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Leider A.; Siddiqui S.; Sabol D.A.; Tappert C.C.,,o,,1,2024-02-21 20:28:05,

Finding truly quantum algorithms is quite difficult, and many of these genuine quantum algorithms, like Shor's prime factoring or phase estimation, require extremely long circuit depth for any practical application, which necessitates error correction. In contrast, we show that machine learning can be used as a systematic method to construct algorithms, that is, to non-algorithmically 'program' quantum computers. Quantum machine learning enables us to perform computations without breaking down an algorithm into its gate 'building blocks', eliminating that difficult step and potentially increasing efficiency by simplifying and reducing unnecessary complexity. In addition, our non-algorithmic machine learning approach is robust to both noise and to decoherence, which is ideal for running on inherently noisy NISQ devices which are limited in the number of qubits available for error correction.

We show that this same task can in fact be performed non-interactively (with setup) and in zero-knowledge. Our protocols result from a sequence of significant improvements to the original four-message protocol of Mahadev. We begin by making the first message instance-independent and moving it to an offline setup phase. We then establish a parallel repetition theorem for the resulting three-message protocol, with an asymptotically optimal rate. This, in turn, enables an application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, eliminating the second message and giving a non-interactive protocol. Finally, we employ classical non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments and classical fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to give a zero-knowledge variant of this construction. This yields the first purely classical NIZK argument system for QMA, a quantum analogue of NP. We establish the security of our protocols under standard assumptions in quantum-secure cryptography.

For the specific case of quantum computation we know, from work over the past decade, that blind delegation protocols can achieve information-theoretic security (provided the client and the server exchange some amount of quantum information). In this paper we prove, provided certain complexity-theoretic conjectures are true, that the power of information-theoretically secure blind delegation protocols for quantum computation (ITS-BQC protocols) is in a number of ways constrained. In the first part of our paper we provide some indication that ITS-BQC protocols for delegating polynomial-time quantum computations in which the client and the server interact only classically are unlikely to exist. We first show that having such a protocol in which the client and the server exchange O(nd) bits of communication, implies that BQP ? MA/O(nd). We conjecture that this containment is unlikely by proving that there exists an oracle relative to which BQP 6? MA/O(nd). We then show that if an ITS-BQC protocol exists in which the client and the server interact only classically and which allows the client to delegate quantum sampling problems to the server (such as BosonSampling) then there exist non-uniform circuits of size 2n??(n/log(n)), making polynomially-sized queries to an NPNP oracle, for computing the permanent of an n ? n matrix. The second part of our paper concerns ITS-BQC protocols in which the client and the server engage in one round of quantum communication and then exchange polynomially many classical messages. First, we provide a complexity-theoretic upper bound on the types of functions that could be delegated in such a protocol by showing that they must be contained in QCMA/qpoly ? coQCMA/qpoly.

Specifically, we concatenate a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a reduction in the system dimension, where the interactions between divided subsystems are taken as an effective Hamiltonian expanded by the reduced basis. Then the effective Hamiltonian is further solved by the VQE, which we call deep VQE. Deep VQE allows us to apply quantum-classical hybrid algorithms on small-scale quantum computers to large systems with strong intrasubsystem interactions and weak intersubsystem interactions, or strongly correlated spin models on large regular lattices. As proof-of-principle numerical demonstrations, we use the proposed method for quasi-one-dimensional models, including one-dimensionally coupled 12-qubit Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on kagome lattices as well as two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnetic models on square lattices. The largest problem size of 64 qubits is solved by simulating 20-qubit quantum computers with a reasonably good accuracy approximately a few %. The proposed scheme enables us to handle the problems of >1000 qubits by concatenating VQEs with a few tens of qubits. While it is unclear how accurate ground-state energy can be obtained for such a large system, our numerical results on a 64-qubit system suggest that deep VQE provides a good approximation (discrepancy within a few percent) and has room for further improvement.

It is necessary to actively correct errors in the execution of a quantum circuit. Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are developed to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. With QEC, one logical circuit is converted into an encoded circuit. Most studies on quantum circuit compilation focus on NISQ devices which have 10-100 qubits and are not fault-tolerant. In this paper, we focus on the compilation for fault-tolerant quantum hardware. In particular, we focus on optimizing communication parallelism for the surface code based QEC. The execution of surface code circuits involves non-trivial geometric manipulation of a large lattice of entangled physical qubits. A two-qubit gate in surface code is implemented as a virtual 'pipe'in space-time called a braiding path. The braiding paths should be carefully routed to avoid congestion. Communication between qubits is considered the major bottleneck as it involves scheduling and searching for simultaneous paths between qubits. We provide a framework for efficiently scheduling braiding paths.We discover that for quantum programs with a local parallelism pattern, our framework guarantees an optimal solution, while the previous greedy-heuristic-based solution cannot.

No initializations of qubits are allowed during the computation, nor are intermediate measurements. The main contribution of this paper is to develop unexpectedly strong error-reduction methods for such quantum computations that simultaneously reduce the number of necessary clean qubits. It is proved that any problem solvable by a polynomialtime quantum computation with one-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits is also solvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits, and with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is further proved in the twosided- error case that any problem solvable by such a computation with a constant gap between completeness and soundness using logarithmically many clean qubits is also solvable with exponentially small two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is available, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error in one of the completeness and soundness and with polynomially small error in the other. An immediate consequence is that the Trace Estimation problem defined with fixed constant threshold parameters is complete for BQ[1]P and BQlogP, the classes of problems solvable by polynomial-time quantum computations with completeness 2/3 and soundness 1/3 using just one and logarithmically many clean qubits, respectively. The techniques used for proving the error-reduction results may be of independent interest in themselves, and one of the technical tools can also be used to show the hardness of weak classical simulations of one-clean-qubit computations (i.e., DQC1 computations).",Power of quantum computation with few clean qubits,"Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, LIPIcs",Fujii K.; Kobayashi H.; Morimae T.; Nishimura H.; Tamate S.; Tani S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 15:32:10,

We demonstrate the ability to directly estimate the Jacobian and Hessian of the corresponding learning problem on a quantum computer, allowing us to learn the Hamiltonian parameters.

As qubits are very sensitive to noise, they rely on continuous error correction to maintain the correct state. Current proposals rely on software-managed error correction and require large instruction bandwidth, which must scale in proportion to the number of qubits. While such a design may be reasonable for small-scale quantum computers, we show that instruction bandwidth tends to become a critical bottleneck for scaling quantum computers. In this paper, we show that 99.999% of the instructions in the instruction stream of a typical quantum workload stem from error correction. Using this observation, we propose QuEST (Quantum Error-Correction Substrate), an architecture that delegates the task of quantum error correction to the hardware. QuEST uses a dedicated programmable micro-coded engine to continuously replay the instruction stream associated with error correction. The instruction bandwidth requirement of QuEST scales in proportion to the number of active qubits (typically << 0.1%) rather than the total number of qubits. We analyze the effectiveness of QuEST with area and thermal constraints and propose a scalable microarchitecture using typical Quantum Error Correction Code (QECC) execution patterns. Our evaluations show that QuEST reduces instruction bandwidth demand of several key workloads by five orders of magnitude while ensuring deterministic instruction delivery. Apart from error correction, we also observe a large instruction bandwidth requirement for fault tolerant quantum instructions (magic state distillation). We extend QuEST to manage these instructions in hardware and provide additional reduction in bandwidth.

In a fault-tolerant quantum computer, errors must reach an acceptable level for practical uses according to error detection and error correction processes. However, these processes utilize additional quantum resources. As the depth of the quantum circuit increases, the computation time per qubit increases together with the processing errors.

Moreover, nontrivial two-qubit gates can also be realized with an auxiliary transmon simultaneously coupled to the two target transmons in an effective resonant way. In particular, this proposal can be compatible to various optimal control techniques, which further enhances the robustness of the quantum operations. Therefore, this proposal represents a promising way toward fault-tolerant quantum computation on solid-state quantum?circuits. ? 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Our attacks are not as efficient as polynomial-time attacks making quantum superposition queries, while our attacks use the realistic model and overwhelmingly improve the classical attacks. Our attacks convert a type of classical meet-in-the-middle attacks into quantum ones. The attack cost depends on the number of available qubits and the way to realize the quantum hardware. The tradeoffs between data complexity D and time complexity T against the problem of cardinality N are D2.T2=N and D.T6 = N3 in the best and worst case scenarios to the adversary respectively, while the classic attack requires D.T = N. This improvement is meaningful from an engineering aspect because several existing schemes claim beyond-birthday-bound security for T by limiting the maximum D to be below 2n/2 according to the classical tradeoff D.T = N. Those schemes are broken when quantum computations are available to the adversaries. The attack can be applied to many schemes such as a tweakable block-cipher construction TDR, a dedicated MAC scheme Chaskey, an on-line authenticated encryption scheme McOE-X, a hash function based MAC H2 -MAC and a permutation based MAC keyed-sponge. The idea is then applied to the FX-construction to discover new tradeoffs in the classical query model. ?

A vital advance towards this direction is the development of quantum simulators and their possible implementation either as standalone quantum systems or as compatible software for classical computers with pros and cons. On the other hand, memristive computing has been proposed recently as a tentative unconventional computing scheme promoting the idea of information storage and processing in the same nanoelectronic device. In this paper we present a memristive quantum computing simulator by coupling quantum simulation principles with memristor aspects and enabling us to tackle the existing difficulties on qubit representation in conventional computing systems. For doing so, we utilize the memristances of identical memristors to represent in 3D the qubit state while its corresponding evolution is defined by the memristors input voltages. In particular, we introduce an appropriate correspondence among the aforementioned memristor voltages and the general qubit state rotation, i.e., the one-qubit quantum gates, and as such we reproduce the rotations imposed by the action of quantum gates in the 3D memristance space. Moreover, we also define the action of the CNOT two-qubit gate and simulate entanglement between two qubits paving the way towards the establishment of a universal set for quantum computing.

The classical methods of cryptography are depended on binary bits, which are susceptible to predicting the key during transit. Hence, moving the classical cryptographic scheme to a new fast, and non-vulnerable scheme is time. The principles of quantum mechanics are applied in quantum computing to enhance security which uses qubits for communication. The advantage of using qubits is that it is impossible to make copies of qubits due to the no-cloning theorem. The computations are performed through photons or qubits produced using the photon's polarization. The qubits are disturbed when measured at an incorrect polarization angle due to the principle of uncertainty. The photons are quantized features used to encode the information.

Through reservoir engineering, we show that a structured dissipation can stabilize a two-component SC while autonomously correcting the errors. The implementation of such dissipation only requires low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic mode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as superconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems. Compared to the stabilized cat, the stabilized SC has a much lower dominant error rate and a significantly enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate ? 1 and the engineered dissipation rate ? 2.

Current quantum computers have performed carefully tailored computational tasks that would be difficult or impossible for even the fastest supercomputers in the world. This ?quantum supremacy? result demonstrates that quantum computing is more powerful than classical computing in some computational regimes. At present, it is unknown if any computational problems related to the Earth's subsurface fall within these regimes. Here, we describe an approach to performing seismic inverse analysis that combines a type of quantum computer called a quantum annealer with classical computing. This approach improves upon past work on applying quantum computing to the subsurface (via subsurface hydrology) in two ways. First, the seismic inverse problem enables better performance from the quantum annealer because of the Earth's relatively narrow distribution of P-wave velocities compared to the broad distribution of hydraulic conductivities. Second, we develop an iterative approach to quantum-computational inverse analysis, which works with a realistic set of observations. By contrast, the previous method used an inverse method that depended on an impractically dense set of observations. In combination, these two advances significantly narrow the gap a quantum-computational advantage for a practical subsurface geoscience problem. Closing the gap completely requires more work, but has the potential to dramatically accelerate inverse analyses for subsurface geoscience.

The main challenge is to minimize this communication cost by using efficient circuit partitioning strategies. There are many different partitioning approaches in the literature, but a consensus is needed on the best method for distribution scenarios. Here, we explore the partitioning process of quantum circuits using a hypergraphic representation for the circuit, to run this task. First, explore and compare different approaches of hypergraphic partitioning. Then, we created a variation of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic to minimize the communication qubits between partitions. Thanks to our tunning and an applied approach, we reduced the cost of partitioning circuits of 10% to 50% with respect to the different algorithms from state of art. Our method involves three steps: logical segmentation and grouping of gates; translation of the circuit into a hypergraphic representation; and use of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic variation for hypergraphic partitioning.

In a quickly evolving technology landscape, QC is emerging as a promising pathway to overcome the growth limits in classical computing. In some cases, QC platforms offer the potential to vastly outperform the familiar classical computer by solving problems more quickly or that may be intractable on any known classical platform. As further performance gains for classical computing platforms are limited by diminishing Moore's Law scaling, QC platforms might be viewed as a potential successor to the current field of exascale-class platforms. While present-day QC hardware platforms are still limited in scale, the field of quantum computing is robust and rapidly advancing in terms of hardware capabilities, software environments for developing quantum algorithms, and educational programs for training the next generation of scientists and engineers. After a brief introduction to QC concepts, the focus of this article is to explore the interplay between the fields of visualization and QC.

We use the notion of a quantum kernel to describe such an ensemble. Quantum kernel is not strictly connected with certain particles; it permanently exchanges atoms and molecules with the environment, which makes quantum kernel a virtual notion. There are many reasons to expect that the state of quantum kernel of a living system can be treated as the stationary state of some Hamiltonian. While the quantum kernel is responsible for the stability of dynamics at the time scale of cellular life, at the longer inter-generation time scale it can change, varying smoothly in the course of biological evolution.

QuPAA provides a series of mechanisms, including parallelism exploitation, microcode streaming, and a quantum flexible instruction set (QuFIS). These mechanisms assist QuPAA to generate instructions adaptively and reduce the requirement for coherence time and instruction bandwidth. The evaluation results show that, compared to the baseline quantum computer with a single AWG unit, QuPAA reduces 25.9% to 97.4% coherence time requirement, and saves 26.9% to 79.1 % instruction bandwidth.

However, not all computing resources are cheap to consume. In High-Performance (HPC) and Quantum Computing (QC), executions can consume considerable amounts of energy and time, which is reserved and used even if the very first steps in the process fail. This means that developers must assume a different attitude towards programming, and aim at error-free software before its execution. This is commonly facilitated using simulators, which are commonplace for both HPC and QC. However the fashion developers advance from one tool to another is ad-hoc, with no established software engineering guidelines, and the final step from simulators to HPC/QC is still a leap of faith, comparable to releasing software. In this paper, we propose a vision where developers can iterate in an agile fashion when developing quantum software. The iterations are defined such that when the solution is still vague in the beginning, computations are interactive and provide instant feedback, thus supporting conceptualization of the software and experimenting with new ideas.

The involvement of big players like Google, IBM, Intel, Rigetti, or Microsoft furthermore led to a momentum which increases the demand for automated design methods for quantum computations. In this context, decision diagrams for quantum computation provide a major pillar as they allow to efficiently represent quantum states and quantum operations which, otherwise, have to be described in terms of exponentially large state vectors and unitary matrices. However, current decision diagrams for the quantum domain suffer from a tradeoff between accuracy and compactness, since: 1) small errors that are inevitably introduced by the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic can harm the compactness (i.e., the size of the decision diagram) significantly and 2) overcompensating these errors (to increase compactness) may lead to an information loss and introduces numerical instabilities. In this article, we describe and evaluate the effects of this tradeoff which clearly motivates the need for a solution that is perfectly accurate and compact at the same time. More precisely, we show that the tradeoff indeed weakens current design automation approaches for quantum computation (possibly leading to corrupted results or infeasible run-times). To overcome this, we propose an alternative approach that utilizes an algebraic representation of the occurring complex and irrational numbers and outline how this can be incorporated in a decision diagram which is suited for quantum computation.

Network slicing has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by enabling the creation of multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure. However, achieving optimal network slicing efficiency remains a critical task due to resource allocation and management complexity. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance network slicing efficiency in self-organizing networks (SONs) using quantum computing.

By harnessing the power of quantum algorithms, the study aims to address the resource allocation and optimization challenges in network slicing. The proposed approach leverages quantum-inspired optimization algorithms, such as quantum annealing and quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms, to tackle the resource allocation problem.

Careful design of low-level controls has been shown to compensate for the processes that induce hardware errors, leveraging techniques from optimal and robust control. However, these techniques rely heavily on the availability of highly accurate and detailed physical models, which generally achieve only sufficient representative fidelity for the most simple operations and generic noise modes. In this work, we use deep reinforcement learning to design a universal set of error-robust quantum logic gates in runtime on a superconducting quantum computer, without requiring knowledge of a specific Hamiltonian model of the system, its controls, or its underlying error processes. We experimentally demonstrate that a fully autonomous deep-reinforcement-learning agent can design single qubit gates up to 3? faster than default DRAG operations without additional leakage error, and exhibiting robustness against calibration drifts over weeks. We then show that ZX(-?/2) operations implemented using the cross-resonance interaction can outperform hardware default gates by over 2? and equivalently exhibit superior calibration-free performance up to 25 days post optimization. We benchmark the performance of deep-reinforcement-learning-derived gates against other black-box optimization techniques, showing that deep reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or marginally superior performance, even with limited hardware access. ? 2021 authors.",Experimental Deep Reinforcement Learning for Error-Robust Gate-Set Design on a Superconducting Quantum Computer,PRX Quantum,Baum Y.; Amico M.; Howell S.; Hush M.; Liuzzi M.; Mundada P.; Merkh T.; Carvalho A.R.R.; Biercuk M.J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 15:41:12,

Given such sources, each photon needs to pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that, once scaled up, allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-deterministically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states - necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a 'ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time steps.

We show that a semiclassical theory of electrodynamics in which the fermions are quantized but the electromagnetic field is not, and in which the particles and the field interact in a natural way, does have such a nonlinear component. We argue that in many situations this semiclassical theory will be a close approximation to quantum field theory. In a more speculative argument, we discuss the possibility that the apparent quantization of the electromagnetic field could be a result of (1) quantization of interactions of the electromagnetic field with matter and (2) wave packets, regions within the electromagnetic field that are approximate photons. At the least this gives a theory which, if crude, avoids the major divergences of standard quantum field theory.

The FPGA design enables the leveraging of the high frame rate capabilities of the DMD as well as ensuring deterministic operation by first storing this USB data on an external DDR memory and updating the micromirror states upon receiving an external trigger pulse. The DMD is imaged onto a scientific camera and two photodiodes as a means of verifying the system behavior and investigating the metrics of interest. Using this framework, the DLP7000 consisting of 768x1024 micromirrors has been shown to refresh at 22 kHz with 45.4 ?s latency. Furthermore, a single block consisting of 48x1024 micromirrors is able to refresh at 140 kHz with 7.1 ?s latency. The loading and clearing behavior of micromirrors has also been characterized for varying refresh rates.  ? 2022 IEEE.",A Control and Testing Framework for a Digital Micromirror Device in Neutral Atom Quantum Computing and Simulation Platforms,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Mathews M.; Yin X.; Baumgartner A.; Esslinger T.; Akin A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:16:07,

It is a grand challenge to computer science to prove that the combination of the two, in analog (continuous variable) quantum computing, offers supersuperTuring capability, the best we can achieve. Computing with continuous spins is now the most promising path AQC. Two papers at SPIE2014 described unbreakable quantum codes using continuous spins beyond what traditional qubits allow. To make this real, we must first develop a realistic ability to model and predict the behavior of networks of spin gates which act in part as polarizers. Last year I proposed a triphoton experiment, where three entangled photons go to linear polarizers set to angles ?a, ?b and ?c. Assuming collapse of the wave function yields predictions for the coincidence detection rate, R3/R0(?a, ?b, ?c) significantly different from the prediction of a new family of models based on classical Markov Random Fields (MRF) across space time, even though both yield the same correct prediction in the two-photon case. We cannot expect to predict systems of 100 entangled photons correctly if we cannot even predict three yet. Yanhua Shih is currently performing this experiment, as a first step to demonstrating a new technology to produce 100 entangled photons (collaborating with Scully) and understanding larger systems.

An error model is proposed, which can be used to estimate the achievable circuit depth and quantum volume of the device as a function of experimental parameters. A new metric based on quantum volume, but with native two-qubit gates, is used to assess the cost of connectivity relative to the upper bound of free, all to all connectivity.

A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDiff with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.  ? 2021 IEEE.",QDiff: Differential Testing of Quantum Software Stacks,"Proceedings - 2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2021",Wang J.; Zhang Q.; Xu G.H.; Kim M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 21:50:32,

To address this problem, this paper proposes a dung beetle search algorithm (QHDBO) based on quantum computing and a multi-strategy hybrid. The good point set strategy is used to initialize the initial population of dung beetles. That makes the initial population more evenly distributed, and reduces the likelihood of the algorithm falling into a local optimum solution. The convergence factor and dynamic balance between the number of Spawning and foraging dung beetles is proposed. That allows the algorithm to focus on the global search in the early stages and local exploration in the later stages. The quantum computing based t-distribution variation strategy is used to variate the optimal global solution, that prevents the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. To verify the performance of the QHDBO algorithm, this paper compares QHDBO with six other swarm intelligence algorithms through 37 test functions and practical engineering application problems.

Arbitrated dynamics between layers of light set up a mechanism of feedback-loops and constitute a process of persistent quantum-level computation, whose output is suggested to be genetic-type information. Such arbitrated dynamics are the result of an initiating urge at the material level, and when strong and cohesive enough, result in a state of quantum certainty.

We explicitly identify modules of our drug-design workflow currently amenable to replacement by QC: non-intuitively, we identify the mutation-impact predictor as the best candidate. HypaCADD thus combines classical docking and molecular dynamics with quantum machine learning (QML) to infer the impact of mutations. We present a case study with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) protease and associated mutants. We map a classical machine-learning module onto QC, using a neural network constructed from qubit-rotation gates. We have implemented this in simulation and on two commercial quantum computers.

In this model, the single client with limited quantum ability can give her encrypted data to a powerful but untrusted quantum data server and let the data server computes over the encrypted data without decryption, where the computation is a quantum circuit composed of multiple quantum gates. Then, the client generates the decryption key to decrypt the computing result according to the circuit of computation. However, this model cannot meet the situation of multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data in the cloud environment. To solve this problem, we let the client outsource key generation to a trusted key server, which composes the quantum cloud center with the data server. The clients only perform X and Z operation according to the encryption or decryption key. Then, combined with Grover algorithm, a quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud data based on delegating quantum computing is proposed in this paper.

A typical simple scheme of classification of such images probabilistically assigns a label to each individual pixel omitting information about pixel surroundings. In order to achieve better classification results for real world images one has to agree the local label obtained from the classifier with the classes of pixel neighborhood. A popular way to do it is through a probabilistic graphical model, where label distributions for individual pixels are mapped into a graph of neighborhood relations. One way to realize this approach is to use Ising models, where class probability is mapped to spin energy and class-class interaction is mapped to the spins coupling. By finding low energy states of such an Ising model we can perform post-processing of segmented images. In this work we present how this postprocessing can be implemented using a quantum annealer. ? 2023 IEEE.",Hyper-Spectral Image Classification Using Adiabatic Quantum Computation,International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS),Gardas B.; Glomb P.; Sadowski P.; Puchala Z.; Jalowiecki K.; Pawela L.; Faucoz O.; Brunet P.-M.; Gawron P.; Van Waveren M.; Savinaud M.; Pasero G.; Defonte V.,,o,,1,2024-02-23 19:14:35,

Recently, the use of graphs in application domains such as routing, network analysis and resource allocation has become crucial. In these areas, graphs are often evolving in time: for example, connection links may fail due to temporary technical issues, meaning that edges of the graph cannot be traversed for some time interval and alternative paths have to be followed. In classical computation, where graphs are represented as adjacency matrices or lists, these problems are well studied and ad-hoc visit procedures have been developed. For specific problems quantum computation, through superpositions and entanglement has provided faster algorithms than their classical counterpart. However, in this model, only reversible operations are allowed and this poses the quest of augmenting a graph in order to be able to reverse edge traversals.

We showed that transition energies of a quantum system are related with the evolution of mean value of a physical quantity. In particular case when the operator of a physical quantity anticommutes with the Hamiltonian of a system we found that studies of the evolution of the mean value of this physical quantity give a possibility to determine the energy levels of the system and their degeneracy. On the basis of the results the energy levels of spin systems were detected on IBMs quantum computers ibmq manila and ibmq melbourne. It is worth noting that spin systems are one of the most suitable systems for modeling them on a quantum computer. We considered a spin in magnetic field, spin chain with Ising interaction, spin square-lattice with isotropic and spatially anisotropic Ising interactions. The results obtained on the quantum devices correspond to the analytical one. It is important to note that finding the maximal or the minimal energy of the Ising model on square lattice with spatially anisotropic interaction is not a trivial problem.

Examples of these problems include identification of conserved functional components (biochemical interactions) across species, structural similarity of large biomolecules, and recurring patterns of interactions in social networks. A large class of such analyses methods quantify the topological similarity of nodes across networks. The resulting correspondence of nodes across networks, also called node alignment, can be used to identify invariant subgraphs across the input graphs. Given k graphs as input, alignment algorithms use topological information to assign a similarity score to each k-tuple of nodes, with elements (nodes) drawn from each of the input graphs. Nodes are considered similar if their neighbors are also similar. An alternate, equivalent view of these network alignment algorithms is to consider the Kronecker product of the input graphs and to identify high-ranked nodes in the Kronecker product graph. Conventional methods such as PageRank and HITS (Hypertext-Induced Topic Selection) can be used for this purpose. These methods typically require computation of the principal eigenvector of a suitably modified Kronecker product matrix of the input graphs. We adopt this alternate view of the problem to address the problem of multiple network alignment. Using the phase estimation algorithm, we show that the multiple network alignment problem can be efficiently solved on quantum computers.

Converting classical image data into the quantum domain and state label preparation complexity is still a challenging issue. The existing techniques normally connect the pixel values and the state position directly. Recently, the EFRQI (efficient flexible representation of the quantum image) approach uses an auxiliary qubit that connects the pixel-representing qubits to the state position qubits via Toffoli gates to reduce state connection. Due to the twice use of Toffoli gates for each pixel connection still it requires a significant number of bits to connect each pixel value. In this paper, we propose a new SCMFRQI (state connection modification FRQI) approach for further reducing the required bits by modifying the state connection using a reset gate rather than repeating the use of the same Toffoli gate connection as a reset gate. Moreover, unlike other existing methods, we compress images using block-level for further reduction of required qubits. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of both image representation and compression points of view. ? 2023 IEEE.",A Novel State Connection Strategy for Quantum Computing to Represent and Compress Digital Images,"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings",Haque M.E.; Paul M.; Ulhaq A.; Debnath T.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:12:49,

However, current quantum devices are subject to errors and noise, which can make the output bits deviate from the uniform distribution.

The circuit model for topological quantum computation differs from the conventional quantum circuit model even in the logic level; which is multiple CNOT gates can only be performed at the same time if the order of qubits satisfies a certain property. Thus, there has been a wide research to find a good qubit order in one-dimension to satisfy such a property for topological quantum computation. This paper proposes a new method by using two-dimensional qubit layouts for topological quantum computation in order to reduce the computational time steps instead of one-dimensional qubit layouts used by the conventional computer. The general idea is to find a good two-dimensional qubit layout, so our propose is to find the best set of one-dimensional qubit layouts exactly by solving a minimum clique partition problem, and by then we will find the best two-dimensional layout that can embed as many of one-dimensional layouts as possible. The further task may need a very time-consuming(exponential number of) enumerations because we try to find the best possible solution by using an efficient graph structure called ?DDs. Indeed, despite this, we still could not find a solution for larger cases more than 16 qubits (4x4 layout) case in our preliminary experiment. Thus, we also implement an SA-based method in order to find a good two-dimensional qubit layout for a reasonable time. Our preliminary experiment shows that the SA-based method works very well for larger cases. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing.",2D qubit layout optimization for topological quantum computation,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),Binti Adnan N.A.; Yamashita S.; Devitt S.J.; Nemoto K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:34:37,

39873651,10.1155/2022/6138434,0,,"Fog computing (FC) based sensor networks have emerged as a propitious archetype for next-generation wireless communication technology with caching, communication, and storage capacity services in the edge. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new era of digital communication and has a rising demand for intelligent devices and applications. It faces performance deterioration and quality of service (QoS) degradation problems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) based scenarios. Therefore, existing caching strategies need to be enhanced to augment the cache hit ratio and manage the limited storage to accelerate content deliveries. Alternatively, quantum computing (QC) appears to be a prospect of more or less every typical computing problem. The framework is basically a merger of a deep learning (DL) agent deployed at the network edge with a quantum memory module (QMM). Firstly, the DL agent prioritizes caching contents via self organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm, and secondly, the prioritized contents are stored in QMM using a Two-Level Spin Quantum Phenomenon (TLSQP). After selecting the most appropriate lattice map (32 ? 32) in 750,000 iterations using SOMs, the data points below the dark blue region are mapped onto the data frame to get the videos. These videos are considered a high priority for trending according to the input parameters provided in the dataset. Similarly, the light-blue color region is also mapped to get medium-prioritized content. After the SOMs algorithm's training, the topographic error (TE) value together with quantization error (QE) value (i.e., 0.0000235) plotted the most appropriate map after 750,000 iterations. In addition, the power of QC is due to the inherent quantum parallelism (QP) associated with the superposition and entanglement principles. A quantum computer taking 'n'qubits that can be stored and execute 2n presumable combinations of qubits simultaneously reduces the utilization of resources compared to conventional computing. It can be analyzed that the cache hit ratio will be improved by ranking the content, removing redundant and least important content, storing the content having high and medium prioritization using QP efficiently, and delivering precise results. The experiments for content prioritization are conducted using Google Colab, and IBM's Quantum Experience is considered to simulate the quantum phenomena.  ? 2022 Tayyabah Hasan et al.",Edge Caching in Fog-Based Sensor Networks through Deep Learning-Associated Quantum Computing Framework,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,Hasan T.; Ahmad F.; Rizwan M.; Alshammari N.; Alanazi S.A.; Hussain I.; Naseem S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:12:30,

True random number generators (TRNG) rely upon sources of randomness from natural processes such as those arising from quantum mechanics phenomena. We demonstrate that a quantum computer can serve as a high-quality, weakly random source for a generalized user-defined probability mass function (PMF). Specifically, QC measurement implements the process of variate sampling according to a user-specified PMF resulting in a word comprised of electronic bits that can then be processed by an extractor function to address inaccuracies due to non-ideal quantum gate operations and other system biases. We introduce an automated and flexible method for implementing a TRNG as a programmed quantum circuit that executes on commercially-available, gate-model quantum computers. The user specifies the desired word size as the number of qubits and a definition of the desired PMF. Based upon the user specification of the PMF, our compilation tool automatically synthesizes the desired TRNG as a structural OpenQASM file containing native gate operations that are optimized to reduce the circuit's quantum depth. The resulting TRNG provides multiple bits of randomness for each execution/measurement cycle; thus, the number of random bits produced in each execution is limited only by the size of the QC.

Today's small-scale quantum computers typically connect each qubit to one or more separate external signal sources. This approach is not scalable due to the input/output (I/O) limitations of the qubit chip, necessitating the integration of control electronics. However, it is no small feat to shrink control electronics into a small package that is compatible with qubit-chip fabrication and operational constraints without sacrificing performance. This so-called 'wiring challenge'is likely to impact the development of more powerful quantum computers even in the near term. In this paper, we address the wiring challenge of trapped-ion quantum computers.

The performer plays the instrument by rotating this sphere using a mouse. Alternatively, a gesture controller can be used, e.g., a VR glove. While the sphere is rotated, a continuously changing sound is produced. The instrument has a ?measure key?.

Then, it sends the program to a quantum computer over the cloud for processing, that is, measuring, in quantum computing terminology. The computer subsequently returns the measurement, which is also rendered into sound.

Recently, a new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the server, the client pays a reward to the server depending on the server's messages and the client's random bits. The rational server sends messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational sumcheck protocol. An advantage of our protocols is that they are gate-set independent: the construction of the previous rational protocols depends on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any local gate set (each of whose elementary gates can be specified with a polynomial number of bits). Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward function satisfies natural requirements (the reward is non-negative, upper-bounded by a constant, and its maximum expected value is lower-bounded by a constant). We also discuss the reward gap. Simply speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept an incorrect answer. The reward gap should therefore be large enough to incentivize the server to behave optimally. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between rational and ordinary delegated quantum computing protocols. This equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method. ? 2022 The Author(s)",Sumcheck-based delegation of quantum computing to rational server,Theoretical Computer Science,Takeuchi Y.; Morimae T.; Tani S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:32:12,

To resolve this, we first explore how to experimentally implement the non-Hermitian non-diagonalizable Hamiltonians, which exhibit EPs, in quantum computers that run on unitary gates. We propose to use an ancilla-based method in this regard. Next, we show how such Hamiltonians can be used for parameter estimation using quantum computers and analyze its performance in terms of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) at EPs, both without noise and in the presence of noise. It is well known that QFI of a parameter to be estimated is inversely related to the variance of the parameter by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Therefore, the divergence of the QFI at EPs promises sensing advantages. We experimentally demonstrate in a cloud quantum architecture and theoretically show, using Puiseux series, that the QFI indeed diverges in such EP systems that were earlier considered to be non-divergent. ? 2024 Author(s).",Simulation of exceptional-point systems on quantum computers for quantum sensing,AVS Quantum Science,Waghela C.; Dasgupta S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:07:26,

A distinctive feature of our work is the treatment of discretization of the optimization problem wherein we discretize not only independent variables (such as time) but also dependent variables. Our discretization scheme enables a reduction in computational cost through selection of coarse-grained states. It further facilitates the solution of the trajectory optimization problem via classical discrete search algorithms including deterministic and stochastic methods for obtaining a global optimum. This framework also allows us to efficiently use quantum computational algorithms for global trajectory optimization. We demonstrate that the discrete search problem can be solved by a variety of techniques including a deterministic exhaustive search in the physical space or the coefficient space, a randomized search algorithm, a quantum search algorithm or by employing a combination of randomized and quantum search algorithms depending on the nature of the problem. We illustrate our methods by solving some canonical problems in trajectory optimization. We also present a comparative study of the performances of different methods in solving our example problems.

Firstly, based on a diversified initial population strategy, an improved circle chaotic mapping theory was proposed, and an initial population with more randomness and diversity was obtained by combining quantum computations with a quantum gate mutation mechanism. Secondly, using an enhanced search strategy, an adaptive T-distribution and a new position update formula were constructed to accelerate the convergence and enhance its variability. Finally, a dynamic evolution formula was designed for the precision elimination mechanism. Based on this, individuals with poor fitness are replaced by new individuals generated using this formula. In addition, a new boundary control strategy was proposed. The convergence of QMESSA was systematically proven, and the proposed algorithm was tested on 24 benchmark functions and CEC 2017 functions. The experiment results as well as the results of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test show that QMESSA achieves a better comprehensive performance than SSA and other advanced optimization algorithms.

Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed routinely to analyze and process these big EO data, and one well-known ML technique is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). An SVM poses a quadratic programming problem, and quantum computers including quantum annealers (QA) as well as gate-based quantum computers promise to solve an SVM more efficiently than a conventional computer; training the SVM by employing a quantum computer/conventional computer represents a quantum SVM (qSVM)/classical SVM (cSVM) application. However, quantum computers cannot tackle many practical EO problems by using a qSVM due to their very low number of input qubits. Hence, we assembled a coreset (?core of a dataset') of given EO data for training a weighted SVM on a small quantum computer, a D-Wave quantum annealer with around 5000 input quantum bits. The coreset is a small, representative weighted subset of an original dataset, and its performance can be analyzed by using the proposed weighted SVM on a small quantum computer in contrast to the original dataset. As practical data, we use synthetic data, Iris data, a Hyperspectral Image (HSI) of Indian Pine, and a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image of San Francisco. We measured the closeness between an original dataset and its coreset by employing a Kullback?Leibler (KL) divergence test, and, in addition, we trained a weighted SVM on our coreset data by using both a D-Wave quantum annealer (D-Wave QA) and a conventional computer. Our findings show that the coreset approximates the original dataset with very small KL divergence (smaller is better), and the weighted qSVM even outperforms the weighted cSVM on the coresets for a few instances of our experiments. As a side result (or a by-product result), we also present our KL divergence findings for demonstrating the closeness between our original data (i.e., our synthetic data, Iris data, hyperspectral image, and PolSAR image) and the assembled coreset. ? 2021 by the authors.

UQ is first applied to a quantum circuit to quantify the uncertainties of gate operators based upon measurements of the circuit?s quantum state probability. This uncertainty is combined with GSA to determine (1) the most influential gate angle parameter or parameter combination (based upon first-order and higher-order sensitivity indices) that provides the highest contribution controlling the circuit output, (2) the least or non-influential gate angle parameters on the circuit output. We apply the method to a Gauss quadrature numerical integration quantum circuit that is implemented on IBM quantum hardware. We identify one quantum gate angle that has a sufficiently large first-order effect, but practically no higher- order effects and minimal parameter correlation. This provides a simplified tuning strategy that allows independent parameter adjustments to enhance the accuracy of the calculation. Significant enhancement in numerical integration is shown via hardware validation which results in a reduction of error from 3.74% using nominal gate angle parameters to 0.42% using the compensated gate angle that is guided by the UQ-GSA results. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Quantifying the uncertainty and global sensitivity of quantum computations on experimental hardware,Quantum Information Processing,Xu G.; Arachchilage K.H.; Hussaini M.Y.; Oates W.S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:48:41,

In the real world, it is never simple to track down and apprehend a cybercriminal. Even if the perpetrator is captured, it will be challenging to secure his conviction since there are not enough standardized digital investigation models. As a consequence of a badly handled forensic investigation, a person who committed a cyber crime may go free, while an innocent person may be subject to adverse ramifications as a result of the inquiry. Forensic investigators are required to adhere to consistent and well-defined forensic methods in order to successfully capture and prosecute cyber criminals. In recent years, a number of new investigating models for digital forensics have been developed; nonetheless, the percentage of cases that result in a conviction remains low since the same investigation model is not relevant in all nations.

We extended these three approaches by allowing for stochastic actions instead of deterministic actions and by introducing a new learning technique called curriculum learning. With curriculum learning, we gradually increase the complexity of the environment and we find that it has a positive effect on the expected reward of a traversal.

Previous approaches to suppressing ZZ crosstalk have mainly relied on specific chip design that can complicate chip fabrication and aggravate decoherence. To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on pulse optimization to suppress ZZ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved. To address the above problems, we propose a scalable approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an ability to suppress ZZ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods. We have conducted extensive evaluations by simulation and on a real quantum computer. Simulation results show that our proposal can improve the fidelity of quantum computing on 4g1/412 qubits by up to 81? (11? on average). Ramsey experiments on a real quantum computer also demonstrate that our method can eliminate the effect of ZZ crosstalk to a great extent.  ? 2022 ACM.",Suppressing ZZ Crosstalk of Quantum Computers through Pulse and Scheduling Co-Optimization,International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS,Xie L.; Zhai J.; Zhang Z.; Allcock J.; Zhang S.; Zheng Y.-C.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:53:39,

Some of the latest research is the optimization of computationally expensive algorithms with quantum computing and transforming stochastic procedures into the semantics of quantum theory. The quest for the learning-based algorithm is aspiring: the discipline seeks to comprehend what learning is and studies how algorithms approximate learning. Quantum machine learning takes these aspirations further by looking at the subatomic level to aid learning. Machine learning-based algorithms minimize a constrained multivariate function. Different algorithms have different hyper-parameters that need to be tuned for the trained model to generalize well. Such optimization has high time and space complexity, which is central to learning theory. This contribution gives an organized overview of the evolving arena of quantum machine learning.

We show that the resulting scheme satisfies a stronger quantum computational binding property, which we will call predicate-binding, than the trivial honest-binding. Intuitively and very roughly, the predicate-binding property guarantees that given any inconsistent predicate pair over a set of strings (i.e. no strings in this set can satisfy both predicates), if a (claimed) quantum commitment can be opened so that the revealed string satisfies one predicate with certainty, then the same commitment cannot be opened so that the revealed string satisfies the other predicate (except for a negligible probability).

The elders? food security predictions require calculations about environmental systems and their complex interactions based on (1) a millennium or more of the Inuit people?s experiences and (2) a continually evolving understanding of these experiences. When the elders engage in their decision-making process, they achieve superposition?that is to say that the elders, collectively, are able to achieve a unified perspective that encompasses the sum total unique understanding of the world of each elder.

Yet, for its practicality, the main challenge to overcome is improving the quantum measurement efficiency. Numerous quantum measurement techniques have been developed recently, but it is unclear how these state-of-the-art measurement techniques will perform in extensions of VQE for obtaining excited electronic states. Assessing the measurement techniques' performance in the excited state VQE is crucial because the measurement requirements in these extensions are typically much greater than in the ground state VQE, as one must measure the expectation value of multiple observables in addition to that of the electronic Hamiltonian. Here, we adapt various measurement techniques to two widely used excited state VQE algorithms: multistate contraction and quantum subspace expansion. Then, the measurement requirements of each measurement technique are numerically compared. We find that the best methods for multistate contraction are ones utilizing Hamiltonian data and wave function information to minimize the number of measurements. In contrast, randomized measurement techniques are more appropriate for quantum subspace expansion, with many more observables of vastly different energy scales to measure. Nevertheless, when the best possible measurement technique for each excited state VQE algorithm is considered, significantly fewer measurements are required in multistate contraction than in quantum subspace expansion.  ? 2023 American Chemical Society.",Measurement Optimization Techniques for Excited Electronic States in Near-Term Quantum Computing Algorithms,Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation,Choi S.; Izmaylov A.F.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:12:35,

The phase noise (PN) specification of the oscillator is derived based on the control fidelity for a single-qubit operation. To reveal the substantial gap between the theoretical predictions and measurement results at cryogenic temperatures, a new PN expression for an oscillator is derived by considering the shot-noise effect. To reach the optimum performance of an LC oscillator, a common-mode (CM) resonance technique is implemented. Additionally, this work presents a digital calibration loop to adjust the CM frequency automatically at 4.2K, reducing the oscillator's PN and thus improving the control fidelity. The calibration technique reduces the flicker corner of the oscillator over a wide temperature range (10 $\times $ and 8 $\times $ reduction at 300K and 4.2K, respectively).

As the number of qubits within a device increases, a number of factors contribute to decreases in yield and performance. To meet this challenge, distributed architectures composed of many networked quantum computers have been proposed as a viable path to scalability. Such systems will need algorithms and compilers that are tailored to their distributed architectures. In this work we introduce the Quantum Divide and Conquer Algorithm (QDCA), a hybrid variational approach to mapping large combinatorial optimization problems onto distributed quantum architectures. This is achieved through the combined use of graph partitioning and quantum circuit cutting. The QDCA, an example of application-compiler co-design, alters the structure of the variational ansatz to tame the exponential compilation overhead incurred by quantum circuit cutting. The result of this cross-layer co-design is a highly flexible algorithm which can be tuned to the amount of classical or quantum computational resources that are available, and can be applied to both near- and long-term distributed quantum ar-chitectures. We simulate the QDCA on instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem and find that it is able to outperform similar classical algorithms. We also evaluate an 8-qubit QDCA ansatz on a superconducting quantum computer and show that circuit cutting can help to mitigate the effects of noise. Our work demonstrates how many small-scale quantum computers canwork together to solve problems 85 % larger than their own qubit count, motivating the development and potential of large-scale distributed quantum computing. ? 2023 IEEE.",Divide and Conquer for Combinatorial Optimization and Distributed Quantum Computation,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",Tomesh T.; Saleem Z.H.; Perlin M.A.; Gokhale P.; Suchara M.; Martonosi M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:11:10,

This work combines machine learning techniques with million-atom simulations of scanning tunnelling microscopic (STM) images of dopants to formulate a theoretical framework capable of determining the number of dopants at a particular qubit location and their positions with exact lattice site precision. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 100,000 simulated STM images, acquiring a characterisation fidelity (number and absolute donor positions) of >98% over a set of 17,600 test images including planar and blurring noise commensurate with experimental measurements.

The signal readout time is a primary property of quantum computing, which is grounded in and proportional to the bulk resistance of the MCP multiplier. Notwithstanding, the bulk resistance of the MCP multiplier became giant at cryogenic temperature for the property of huge negative temperature coefficient of resistance, almost 105 Gohm at 20K~30K, resulting in a readout time of 10-2-1s at cryogenic temperature. That was one of the major bottlenecks for the cryogenic quantum computing application of MCPs. In this paper, ruthenium oxide films were sol-gel deposited onto the lead-bismuth-silicate glass, one kind of the base material for MCPs, produced by the Research and Development Center of Microchannel Plate, China Building Materials Academy.

Existing quantum programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of 1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient, high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and 2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting quantum architectures.

To address the above challenges, we propose a commutativity based compile-time instruction reordering approach. We first propose a complete set of generalized commutativity rules for main types of quantum gates, and then we design a two-level bidirectional reordering algorithm to reorder gates according to these rules for effective crosstalk mitigation.

A key question addressed is what such a quantum computer is and how it relates to the classical processor that controls the entire execution process. In this article, we present explicitly the idea of a quantum accelerator that contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such a stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the accelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm that is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case, the logic is expressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language developed in the group, called OpenQL, which visualized the quantum processor as a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a common assembly language, called cQASM, which can be executed on a quantum simulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the microarchitecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. In a subsequent step, the compiler can convert the cQASM to generate the eQASM, which is executable on a particular experimental device incorporating the platform-specific parameters. This way, we are able to distinguish clearly the experimental research toward better qubits, and the industrial and societal applications that need to be developed and executed on a quantum device. The first case offers experimental physicists with a full-stack experimental platform using realistic qubits with decoherence and error-rates, whereas the second case offers perfect qubits to the quantum application developer, where there is neither decoherence nor error-rates. We conclude the article by explicitly presenting three examples of full-stack quantum accelerators, for an experimental superconducting processor, for quantum accelerated genome sequencing and for near-term generic optimization problems based on quantum heuristic approaches. The two later full-stack models are currently being actively researched in our group. ? 2021 IEEE.",Quantum Computer Architecture Toward Full-Stack Quantum Accelerators,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,Koen B.; Sarkar A.; Hubregtsen T.; Serrao M.; Mouedenne A.A.; Yadav A.; Krol A.; Ashraf I.; Almudever C.G.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 15:55:31,

Due to the volume and scope of the huge data, training an ANN in this situation is a difficult process.

MycobacteriumTB drug resistance is a serious impediment to allelopathy therapy. Contemplating combinatorial drug delivery (pharmaceutical cocrystal) as anti-TB medicines targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis's active site can be an alternative strategy. The syringic acid nicotinamide (SYNI) cocrystal was synthesized in this work through slow evaporation technique and was examined based on quantum chemical calculations, Hirshfeld analysis, electron localization analysis and molecular docking. The intended vibrational wavenumbers were allocated a PED value and related with experimental frequencies. The UV-Visible absorption spectra of the cocrystal in the liquid phase (ethanol) were revealed as n ? ?*electronic transitions. The HOMO-LUMO values, band gap, molecular electrostatic potential and Mulliken atomic charge distribution of the molecule were evaluated to estimate its stability and molecular reactivity. The molecule's second-order perturbation energy E(2) standards were determined by means of natural bond orbital analysis, and potential reactive site was assessed using local reactivity descriptors. Hirshfeld analysis revealed that H...H (44.9%), O...H/H...O (39.3%), C...H/H...C (6.1%), N...H/H...N (5.3%) and C...C (2.4%) have the major percentage contributions from the most significant interactions. The topological features of the SYNI cocrystal were assessed through electron localization function based on color gradient. The binding ability of SYNI cocrystal with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated proteins was evaluated through docking and their binding scores fall between the range of -9.1 kcal/mol and -10.8 kcal/mol, which confirms the better binding ability and makes SYNI cocrystal a potent medication against TB. ? 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Insight with Crystallization, Quantum Computation, Hirshfeld, ELF/LOL and Molecular Docking of Syringic Acid Nicotinamide Cocrystal as Potent Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Inhibitor",Journal of Computational Biophysics and Chemistry,Zochedh A.; Shunmuganarayanan A.; Sultan A.B.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:52:55,

By exploring properties as the sparsity of the Identity operator and partiality of dense unitary transformations, better storage and distribution of quantum information are achieved.

This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation algorithms? performance to solve two common COP, namely the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem. Two accepted classical optimisation methods, Branch and Bound and Simulated Annealing, are compared to two quantum optimisation methods, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are, respectively, executed on both classical devices and IBM?s suite of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

Our experimental results show that current classical devices significantly outperform the presently available NISQ devices, which both agree with and extend on those findings reported in the literature. Further, we introduce additional performance metrics to better compare the two approaches with respect to computational time, feasibility and solution quality. Our results show that the VQE performs better than QAOA with respect to these metrics, and we infer that this is due to the increased number of operations required. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a new set of basis gates on the quantum optimisation techniques and show they yield no notable improvement on obtained results.

In this novel quantum algorithm, the oracles of the two evaluated functions are executed in series to yield a common target qubit which then interacts with an ancillary qubit. We found that the degree of entanglement (measured by the concurrence) of the target and ancillary qubits is a reliable witness for the logical equivalence property of the two functions. The steps number of the quantum algorithm is inversely proportional to the square of the standard error ?2 of the measured concurrence value, with no dependence on the input size ?n? of each function. This corresponds to a number of evaluations of the two functions: O(??2) for the quantum algorithm compared with O(2n) for the classical approach. To assess the algorithm performance, two sets of experiments are conducted using the IBM Q Experience simulator for input sizes: 2 and 12 variables per function. While the former verifies that the results of the experiment are in a good match with the theory, the latter showcases the quantum supremacy of the presented algorithm.

We consider the n-dimensional lattice with holes at all length scales the corresponding fractal (Hausdorff) dimension of which is DH=n-?. In particular, we diagnose the existence of the topological order through the lens of quantum information and geometry, i.e., via its equivalence to a quantum error-correcting code with a macroscopic code distance or the presence of macroscopic systoles in systolic geometry. We first prove a no-go theorem that ZN topological order cannot survive on any fractal embedded in two spatial dimensions and with DH=2-?. For fractal-lattice models embedded in three dimensions (3D) or higher spatial dimensions, ZN topological order survives if the boundaries on the holes condense only loop or, more generally, k-dimensional membrane excitations (k?2), thus predicting the existence of fractal topological quantum memories (at zero temperature) or topological codes that are embeddable in 3D. Moreover, for a class of models that contain only loop or membrane excitations and are hence self-correcting on an n-dimensional manifold, we prove that ZN topological order survives on a large class of fractal geometries independent of the type of hole boundary and is hence extremely robust. We further construct fault-tolerant logical gates in the Z2 version of these fractal models, which we term fractal surface codes, using their connection to global and higher-form topological symmetries equivalent to sweeping the corresponding gapped domain walls. In particular, we discover a logical controlled-controlled-Z (ccz) gate corresponding to a global symmetry in a class of fractal codes embedded in 3D with Hausdorff dimension asymptotically approaching DH=2+? for arbitrarily small ?, which hence only requires a space overhead ?(d2+?), where d is the code distance. This in turn leads to the surprising discovery of certain exotic gapped boundaries that only condense the combination of loop excitations and certain gapped domain walls. We further obtain logical CpZ gates with p?n-1 on fractal codes embedded in n dimensions. In particular, for the logical Cn-1Z in the nth level of the Clifford hierarchy, we can reduce the space overhead to ?(dn-1+?). On the mathematical side, our findings in this paper also lead to the discovery of macroscopic relative systoles in a class of fractal geometries.  ? 2022 authors.

In order to assess such a multimillion scale of identical qubits and control lines, the silicon platform seems to be one of the most indicated routes as it naturally provides, together with qubit functionalities, the capability of nanometric, serial, and industrial-quality fabrication. The scaling trend of microelectronic devices predicting that computing power would double every 2 years, known as Moore's law, according to the new slope set after the 32-nm node of 2009, suggests that the technology roadmap will achieve the 3-nm manufacturability limit proposed by Kelly around 2020. Today, circuital quantum information processing architectures are predicted to take advantage from the scalability ensured by silicon technology. However, the maximum amount of quantum information per unit surface that can be stored in silicon-based qubits and the consequent space constraints on qubit operations have never been addressed so far. This represents one of the key parameters toward the implementation of quantum error correction for faulttolerant quantum information processing and its dependence on the features of the technology node. The maximum quantum information per unit surface virtually storable and controllable in the compact exchange-only silicon double quantum dot qubit architecture is expressed as a function of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology node, so the size scale optimizing both physical qubit operation time and quantum error correction requirements is assessed by reviewing the physical and technological constraints. According to the requirements imposed by the quantum error correction method and the constraints given by the typical strength of the exchange coupling, we determine the workable operation frequency range of a silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum processor to be within 1 and 100 GHz. Such constraint limits the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum information processing with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology only to the most advanced nodes. The compatibility with classical complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor control circuitry is discussed, focusing on the cryogenic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor operation required to bring the classical controller as close as possible to the quantum processor and to enable interfacing thousands of qubits on the same chip via timedivision, frequency-division, and space-division multiplexing. The operation time range prospected for cryogenic control electronics is found to be compatible with the operation time expected for qubits. By combining the forecast of the development of scaled technology nodes with operation time and classical circuitry constraints, we derive a maximum quantum information density for logical qubits of 2.8 and 4 Mqb/cm6 for the 10 and 7-nm technology nodes, respectively, for the Steane code. The density is one and two orders of magnitude less for surface codes and for concatenated codes, respectively. Such values provide a benchmark for the development of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms by circuital quantum information based on silicon platforms and a guideline for other technologies in general. ?

Furthermore, photonic qubits are easy to manipulate and do not require particularly strongly sealed environments, making them an appealing platform for quantum computing. With the one-way model, the vision of a universal and largescale quantum computer based on photonics becomes feasible. In one-way computing, the input state is not an initial product state 0 ? n, but a socalled cluster state. A series of measurements on the cluster state's individual qubits and their temporal order, together with a feed-forward procedure, determine the quantum circuit to be executed. We propose a pipeline to convert a QASM circuit into a graph representation named measurement-graph (m-graph), that can be directly translated to hardware instructions on an optical one-way quantum computer.

Quantum computing eliminates most of the challenges in IoT. This research provides a comprehensive introduction to the Internet of Things and quantum computing before moving on to public-key cryptography difficulties that may be encountered across the convergence of quantum computing and IoT.

The proposed model prevents eavesdroppers from performing destructive operations in the communication channel and cyber side by preserving its state and protecting the public key using quantum cryptography and the BB84 protocol.

Here, we present a novel ion trapping system where a commercial low-vibration closed-cycle cryostat is used in a custom monolithic enclosure. We measure mechanical vibrations of the sample stage using an optical interferometer, and observe a root-mean-square relative displacement of 2.4 nm and a peak-to-peak displacement of 17 nm between free-space beams and the trapping location.

Unfortunately, these devices are restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges. For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here, we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision. When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through modularity. Our results demonstrate that chiplet architectures, relative to monolithic designs, benefit from average yield improvements ranging from 9.6 - 92.6 ? for ?5 qubit machines. In addition, our simulations explore the design space of chiplet systems and discover configurations that demonstrate average two-qubit gate infidelity reductions that are at best 0.815 ? their monolithic counterpart.

In modeling second-quantized problems, the biggest challenge confronted is that the number of qubits scales linearly with the size of the molecular basis. This poses a significant limitation on the size of the basis sets and the number of correlated electrons included in quantum simulations of chemical processes. To address this issue and enable more realistic simulations on NISQ computers, we employ the double unitary coupled-cluster (DUCC) method to effectively downfold correlation effects into the reduced-size orbital space, commonly referred to as the active space. Using downfolding techniques, we demonstrate that properly constructed effective Hamiltonians can capture the effect of the whole orbital space in small-size active spaces. Combining the downfolding preprocessing technique with the variational quantum eigensolver, we solve for the ground-state energy of H2, Li2, and BeH2 in the cc-pVTZ basis using the DUCC-reduced active spaces.

Thus, researchers in industry and academia have focused on designing in-fridge classical controllers in order to mitigate these challenges. Due to the maturity of CMOS logic, many industrial efforts (Microsoft, Intel) have focused on Cryo-CMOS as a near-term solution to design in-fridge classical controllers. Meanwhile, Supercon-ducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) is an alternative, less mature classical logic family proposed for large-scale in-fridge controllers. SFQ logic has the potential to maximize scalability thanks to its ultra-high speed and very low power consumption. However, architecture design for SFQ logic poses challenges due to its unconventional pulse-driven nature and lack of dense memory and logic. Thus, research at the architecture level is essential to guide architects to design SFQ-based classical controllers for large-scale quantum machines.In this paper, we present DigiQ, the first system-level design of a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)-friendly SFQ-based classical controller. We perform a design space exploration of SFQ-based controllers and co-design the quantum gate decompositions and SFQ-based implementation of those decompositions to find an optimal SFQ-friendly design point that trades area and power for latency and control while ensuring good quantum algorithmic performance. Our co-design results in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) controller architecture, which has high scalability, but imposes new challenges on the calibration of control pulses. We present software-level solutions to address these challenges, which if unaddressed would degrade quantum circuit fidelity given the imperfections of qubit hardware.To validate and characterize DigiQ, we first implement it using hardware description languages and synthesize it using state-of-the-art/validated SFQ synthesis tools.

This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more quantum bits (qubits) and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make quantum computation practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus can not provide useful predictions. Herein, we propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for quantum computations of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H2 and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient quantum computations of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers. ? 2022 authors.

The system will stamp every shipment that is to be traded over the internet as indicated by the group's substance and deliver it via trade media. When it reaches its final destination, the stamping of any package is altered, and the structure is ready to be taken. The majority of PPM concerns have entailed a few issues such as loss of stamping information, issues recreating ambush routes, and low precision than on. In the first paper, we propose a dynamic probabilistic packet marking (DPPM) approach as a replacement for another upgrade reasonability of PPM. On the other hand, if you're utilising mounted checking likelihood, we propose gauging regardless of whether the package has been stamped or not, and then selecting the appropriate checking likelihood. Most of the problems with the PPM approach could be solved using DPPM. A formal examination reveals that DPPM outperforms PPM in a variety of ways. The proposed solution is useful in domains where it is important to keep track of back IP addresses while changing the package, such as cybercrime and the illegal treatment of data groups where certain basic information must be transferred.

This research work helps to identify the diseases of plants. There are many methods to identify the plant?s disease using various techniques and algorithms; in this work, leaf disease is identified focusing on the ailment identification using quantum computing techniques to get a vivid result for better crop production. As there are many diseases in a paddy crop, they have been categorized into two types: nursery diseases and main field diseases. Both types cause a great loss in crop yield. In this research work, main field diseases are studied; though there are various main field diseases, research work targets leaf color changing, and colored spots. The existing methods use hybrid algorithms using AI techniques, but the result is not favorable, therefore, to get a precise result, the methodology is focused on techniques based on quantum computing. The technique to identify disease in a plant varies from leaf to leaf, but the base disease remains the same. Defects like yellow, black, and white spots are common problems. The fungi disease takes the energy from the plants in which they live, this leads to conditions like wilting, scabs, moldy coatings, rusts, blotches, and rotted tissues. All these problems have different existing solutions, through this research work, a minimal fault detection method is identified to reduce the flaws in the paddy crop. As the initial step, paddy crops are taken for research work; later, this can be extended to wheat and maize. The focus is on a hybrid approach of quantum computing and AI as quantum computing techniques help to spot patterns in large data sets. The concept of quantum image processing will help to elaborate the images of a leaf to identify its defect. QIP uses high varied quantum lattice methods to identify clear leaf images by reducing noise and paving the way to identify the discolored leaf at a minimal time. quantum computing possibly paves way for new opportunities in the techniques of Artificial Intelligence, for better predictions and decision-making involving a combination of large data collected from various resources, to produce very clear results. This research work aims to solve the problem of proper identification of paddy crops by studying the image carefully with the designed algorithms to achieve better results that lead to better productivity. The image detection helps to trigger the crop production by routine test work on the image captured thus optimizing the consistency and accuracy. This work also helps to detect the related issues during image computation using image classification techniques. ?

More formally, causality is a property between points in spacetime where a path between them can be traveled at a speed less than that of light, allowing information to travel between them and ensuring they can influence each other. In modern literature, the best working quantum theory, quantum field theory, is deeply intertwined with causality, both at the microscopic and macroscopic scales, and is one of the most promising tools for the major efficiency improvement required for next-generation quantum computers as it stores information globally rather than locally at a point. Thus, efficient causality detection is an important problem, with its fundamental connections to quantum field theory and quantum computing, and due to this significance, previous attempts have been made to detect causality but were inefficient. In this project, we designed a more efficient causality detection algorithm for a class of spacetimes known as globally hyperbolic spacetimes using a stronger link invariant known as the cocycle invariant. We used the Low Conjecture to represent relationships between points in spacetime using link diagrams. Results from cocycle invariant calculations showed a clear distinction between causal and non-causal links, and further use of a queue and constant term reduction enhanced efficiency. Combining this differentiation with data from the Alexander Conway Invariant yielded a detection algorithm that is competitive to and outperforms those in the literature.  ? 2023 IEEE.",Efficient Computation of Causality in Globally Hyperbolic Spacetimes Using Link Invariants and Relevant Applications to Quantum Computing,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",Kim A.; Pitcock J.; Zhang J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 17:51:20,

However, this is based on a block-encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, the implementation of which is known to require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU), which uses a controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit, and no multiqubit control operations and is thus suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that outperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for estimating the ground-state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians, we propose a new method that exploits certain anticommutation relations and further removes the need to implement the controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Coupled with a Trotter-based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM qiskit for the transverse-field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multiqubit Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary amplitude-estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal complexity for ground-state preparation and energy estimation using a constant number of ancilla qubits (no more than three).  ? 2022 authors.

The U.S. Congress and other governmental and industrial organizations have recognized that teaching Quantum Computing in university-level Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs is strategically important for workforce development along with technology development. Success in this endeavor requires generating genuine interest in the topic and motivating potential students. Quantum Computing requires an understanding of relatively difficult related subjects including physics, math and computer science. Many computer science and electrical engineering students shy away from quantum computing because of its complexity. This paper discusses our success with generating interest in quantum computing among graduate students and motivating them through exploring, in related courses, some aspects of quantum computing that have the potential to generate discontinuities. The approach is also examined in terms of the Scientific Learning Cycle as discussed by Wankat Oreovicz. Opportunities and challenges of adding Quantum Computing to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs were studied through a student small group project in a cybersecurity course. The work built on extensive research into the effectiveness of small group projects and the role of 'play' in learning. Our small group project on quantum computing was introduced three years ago into a cybersecurity course which is required for all students in our university's Masters in Computer Science and Masters in Electrical Engineering programs. The basic goals of the project are to teach students some basics of quantum computing by allowing them to 'play with it' and to alert students to the fact that quantum computing is a rapidly developing new field that they need to follow during at least the next decade. The small group project helped students to explore the potential of quantum computing to substantially undermine current Public Key Cryptography and, at the same time provide a new approach to encryption that is even more secure than Public Key Cryptography.

The Clifford+CS gate set is universal for quantum computation and its elements can be implemented fault-tolerantly in most error-correcting schemes through magic state distillation. Since non-Clifford gates are typically more expensive to perform in a fault-tolerant manner, it is often desirable to construct circuits that use few CS gates. In the present paper, we introduce an efficient and optimal synthesis algorithm for two-qubit Clifford+CS operators. Our algorithm inputs a Clifford+CS operator U and outputs a Clifford+CS circuit for U, which uses the least possible number of CS gates. Because the algorithm is deterministic, the circuit it associates to a Clifford+CS operator can be viewed as a normal form for that operator. We give an explicit description of these normal forms and use this description to derive a worst-case lower bound of 5log2(1?)+O(1) on the number of CS gates required to ?-approximate elements of SU(4).

Moreover, traffic congestion will increase the spread of the virus not only because of the vicinity but also because of increased temperature and humidity in these spaces for a short or long time. This paper introduces a vehicle routing optimization model to reduce COVID-19 exposure risk during a city journey by solving it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem on a quantum annealing computer. Indeed, the objective of the COVID-19 prevention optimization problem is to minimize the risk of exposure for a given set of road users between origins and destinations.

One of the solvers is executed on classical computers, and two other solvers are executed on hybrid quantum solvers. Hybrid solvers return the solution within less than 0.03 seconds on quantum processing unit time. However, the results will be returned at least 5 seconds after the execution in the classical solver. It is worth mentioning that, as there is no direct access to the quantum computers, it is hard to compare the results on the same scale as the queries will go on a queue in D-wave quantum computers.

Furthermore, such domains, due to the coherent dynamics, are the pools of quasi-free electrons forming cold coherent vortices upon an energy intake from the outside. Such electrons, in turn, form a plasma that, under suitable conditions, can itself become coherent and oscillate in tune with electromagnetic fields trapped inside it.

Nonetheless, they still are very susceptible to noise and feature only a small amount of qubits, making it possible to only execute short quantum computations. Facing this problem, several approaches were proposed to make the most of the present situation, either by distributing the Quantum load, sending different Quantum programs to different QPUs or by distributing Quantum program fragments, by cutting a Quantum program into multiple smaller chunks. Here, we propose a change of perspective. Due to the probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics, it is usually required to iterate the execution of a Quantum program numerous times or shots. We suggest considering the shots dimension while determining how to distribute quantum computations. In this paper, we design and develop a methodology to distribute the shots of a Quantum program among many QPUs. Exploiting multiple QPUs improves the resilience to potential QPUs failures. Our solution also enables users to directly encode, through a proposed DSL, their own distribution strategies according to their needs and considered scenarios, offering an expressive and customisable approach.

We show by electronic quantum dynamical simulations that the interdot coherent response to ultrashort fs laser pulses can be characterized by pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy in spite of the inevitable inherent size dispersion of colloidal QDs. The latter, leading to a broadening of the excitonic bands, induce accidental resonances that actually increase the e?ciency of the interdot coupling. The optical electronic response is computed by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation including the interaction with the oscillating electric field of the pulses for an ensemble of dimers that differ by their size. The excitonic Hamiltonian of each dimer is parameterized by the QD size and interdot distance, using an effective mass approximation. Local and charge transfer excitons are included in the dimer basis set. By tailoring the QD size, the excitonic bands can be tuned to overlap and thus favor interdot coupling. Computed pump-probe transient absorption maps averaged over the ensemble show that the coherence of excitons in QD dimers that lead to interdot charge migration can survive size disorder and could be observed in fs pump-probe, four-wave mixing, or covariance spectroscopy. ? 2020 by the authors.",Coherent exciton dynamics in ensembles of size-dispersed cdse quantum dot dimers probed via ultrafast spectroscopy: A quantum computational study,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),Gattuso H.; Fresch B.; Levine R.; Remacle F.,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 20:30:46,

Increasing support for mid-circuit measurements and qubit reset in near-term quantum computers enables qubit reuse that may yield quantum computations with fewer qubits and lower errors. In this work, we introduce a formal model for qubit reuse optimization that delivers provably optimal solutions with respect to quantum circuit depth, number of qubits, or number of swap gates for the first time. This is in contrast to related work where qubit reuse is used heuristically or optimally but without consideration of the mapping effort. We further investigate reset errors on near-term quantum computers by performing reset error characterization experiments. Using the hereby obtained reset error characterization and calibration data of a near-term quantum computer, we then determine a qubit assignment that is optimal with respect to a given cost function. We define this cost function to include gate errors and decoherence as well as the individual reset error of each qubit. We found the reset fidelity to be state-dependent and to range, depending on the reset qubit, from 67.5% to 100% in a near-term quantum computer.

However, the overhead of these approaches is one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale quantum computation. In this paper, two approaches for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, mainly based on code concatenation, are proposed. The first approach combines the code concatenation approach with code switching, pieceable fault tolerance or magic state distillation and the second approach extends the nonuniformity of the concatenated codes by allowing to apply CNOT gates between different codes. The proposed approaches outperform the code concatenation approach in terms of both number of qubits and code distance and have also significantly less resource overhead than magic state distillation.

Calibrations of quantum hardware are used to reduce error rates and report error rates. Because calibrations take a significant amount of time they are typically only run once per day. The error rates found are only valid during calibration as error rates drift, can change rapidly and by a factor of 2-3.

It is demonstrated to solve the 2-community detection problem on graphs of sizes of up to 410 vertices using the 16-qubit IBM quantum computer and D-Wave 2000Q, and compare their performance with the optimal solutions. The results herein demonstrate that QLS performs similarly in terms of quality of the solution and the number of iterations to convergence on both types of quantum computers and it is capable of achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art solvers in terms of quality of the solution including reaching the optimal solutions. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The protocols rely on double braids - draids - which flip the signs of both majoranas, as one is taken all the way around the other. Rapid draiding can be used to dynamically suppress some or all intermajorana couplings. Suppressing all couplings can drastically reduce residual majorana dynamics, producing a more robust computational subspace. Nontrivial topological models can be obtained by selectively applying draids to some of the overlapping (imperfect) majoranas. Remarkably, draids can be implemented without having to physically braid majoranas or performing projective measurements. For instance, we show that draids can be performed by periodically modulating the coupling between a quantum dot and a topological superconducting wire to dynamically suppress the hybridization of majoranas in the quantum wire. In current experimental setups, this could lead to suppression of this coupling by a few orders of magnitude. The robustness of this protocol can be shown to parallel the topological robustness of physically braided majoranas. We propose an architecture that implements draids between distant majorana modes within a quantum register using a setup with multiple quantum dots and also discuss measurement-based ways of implementing the same. ? 2020 authors.

39873924,10.1103/PRXQuantum.4,0,,"In the race to build scalable quantum computers, minimizing the resource consumption of their full stack to achieve a target performance becomes crucial. It mandates a synergy of fundamental physics and engineering: the former for the microscopic aspects of computing performance and the latter for the macroscopic resource consumption. For this, we propose a holistic methodology dubbed metric noise resource (MNR) that is able to quantify and optimize all aspects of the full-stack quantum computer, bringing together concepts from quantum physics (e.g., noise on the qubits), quantum information (e.g., computing architecture and type of error correction), and enabling technologies (e.g., cryogenics, control electronics, and wiring). This holistic approach allows us to define and study resource efficiencies as ratios between performance and resource cost. As a proof of concept, we use MNR to minimize the power consumption of a full-stack quantum computer, performing noisy or fault-tolerant computing with a target performance for the task of interest. Comparing this with a classical processor performing the same task, we identify a quantum energy advantage in regimes of parameters distinct from the commonly considered quantum computational advantage. This provides a previously overlooked practical argument for building quantum computers. While our illustration uses highly idealized parameters inspired by superconducting qubits with concatenated error correction, the methodology is universal - it applies to other qubits and error-correcting codes - and it provides experimenters with guidelines to build energy-efficient quantum computers. In some regimes of high energy consumption, it can reduce this consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, our methodology lays the theoretical foundation for resource-efficient quantum technologies.  ? 2023 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.

However, testing quantum computations for faults is currently impractical because of the existence of noise and errors associated with the output. Executing in a quantum system a circuit with only a few valid output states can generate a significant number of implausible states that have zero probability in an ideal computation. Among other sources of noise, readout errors come from the difficulty of discriminating a measurement between 0 and 1 for the different qubits. These issues are affected by readout drift, requiring regular recalibration of the process. In this paper, we provide a novel technique for post-computation analysis of the output probability distributions that permits better discrimination of kerneled data, delaying the need for recalibration. We achieve this by altering the linear discrimination of the final output states by way of a dynamic state selection process that combines Gaussian mixture models with a probability threshold. As an initial assessment of the technique we examine its effect on three to five qubits GHZ states.

In this work, using a minimal model for quantum fault tolerance, we establish a general lower bound on the space overhead required to achieve fault tolerance.

39873936,10.1145/2694344.2694,0,Compilers; LLVM; Quantum; Scheduling,"Quantum computing (QC) offers huge promise to accelerate a range of computationally intensive benchmarks. Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle. Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism. We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories. Our work is the most comprehensive software-to-quantum toolflow published to date, with efficient and practical scheduling techniques that reduce communication and increase parallelism for full-scale quantum code executing up to a trillion quantum gate operations.

Also, various optimizations, regulated by quantitative correlations of cores (one or several cores) and nodes (one or several), are derived. It can be used to implement simulation of a multi-node quantum circuit. Despite the fact that the theory of quantum computation is not yet ready for a conversion from theory to practice, one can imagine a possible form of the future quantum computer and its interface. In addition, it is proved that most non-trivial tasks cannot be solved without the use of entanglement. Recently there has been a rapid growth of interest in quantum computers, especially after the sale of operating quantum computers. The main advantage of quantum computation in comparison with traditional calculations is that they use the property of quantum particles to be simultaneously in many states, which is called superposition. The use of quantum computers can significantly increase the speed of solving computational problems and, most importantly, exponentially increase the speed of NP-complete problems solving, which can be solved for unacceptable time on classic computers. ?

There are many techniques available that make communications in CPS environments secure - such as enabling traffic encryption between sensors and the computers processing the sensor's data, incorporating message authentication codes to achieve integrity, etc. However, most of these techniques are dependent on some form of symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA. These algorithms are under threat because of the emerging quantum computing paradigm: with quantum computing, these encryption algorithms can be potentially broken. It is therefore desirable to explore the use of quantum cryptography - which cannot be broken by quantum computing - for securing the classical communications infrastructure deployed in CPS. In this paper, we discuss possible consequences of this option. We also explain how quantum computers can help even more: namely, they can be used to maximize the system's security where scalability is never a constraint, and to ensure we are not wasting time cycles on communicating and processing irrelevant information. ? 2020 IEEE.",Towards Security of Cyber-Physical Systems using Quantum Computing Algorithms,"SOSE 2020 - IEEE 15th International Conference of System of Systems Engineering, Proceedings",Tosh D.; Galindo O.; Kreinovich V.; Kosheleva O.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:35:15,

Compared with classical computers, it has achieved remarkable success in certain specific tasks. A qubit could be realized from the outermost electron of a phosphorus atom. Over the silicon crystal, an atom of phosphorus was embedded right next to a transistor. This spin of the electron is a magnetic dipole. It has two orientations, up and down, which correspond to the classical 1 and 0. To distinguish between an electron's spin up and spin down energy state, application of a strong magnetic field is required. A pulse of microwave energy can be used to write information onto a qubit by spinning it up, but the frequency must be extremely precise. Electrons oscillate at a specific frequency depending on the magnetic field they are in. As a spin down, the energy is lower, whereas that of a spin up is higher.

Quantum computers hold promise for the capability of sampling from distributions that are hard to sample from with usual (classical) computers. We have recently introduced an adaptive quantum variational algorithm for Gibbs state preparation, a state that can be sampled to yield a thermal (or Gibbs) distribution. This has applications in statistical physics, stochastic processes, and optimization. Here we explore the role of the initial quantum correlations (i.e., entanglement) built into the 'data' quantum bits (those that will be sampled) and the ancilla quantum bits (those that assist in preparing the Gibbs state) in the run-time of the adaptive state-preparation algorithm. Based on our simulations, we conclude that certain types of entangled states perform better for Ising Hamiltonians, while others are more appropriate for XY Hamiltonians.

To ensure successful QSD projects, it is crucial to concentrate on key variables. Objective: This study aims to identify key variables in QSD and develop a model for predicting the success probability of QSD projects. Methodology: We identified key QSD variables from existing literature to achieve these objectives and collected expert insights using a survey instrument. We then analyzed these variables using an optimization model, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), with two different prediction methods the Na?ve Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Logistic Regression (LR). Results: The results of success probability prediction models indicate that as the QSD process matures, project success probability significantly increases, and costs are notably reduced. Furthermore, the best fitness rankings for each QSD project variable determined using NBC and LR indicated a strong positive correlation (rs=0.945). The t-test results (t = 0.851, p = 0.402>0.05) show no significant differences between the rankings calculated by the two methods (NBC and LR).

As a field, it is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together theories from Psychology, Neuroscience, Biology, and others. The field of cognitive science operates at a number of levels. On the one hand, some aspects of cognitive science look at the behaviour of neurons, whereas other aspects look to explain human behaviour at a more abstract level, seeking to explain human decision making or reasoning. A key area of research in cognitive science is how to formalise human behaviours around judgements of similarity, categorization, and decision making. In the field of Physics, Quantum Mechanics has fundamentally altered our understanding of the way in which particles behave. Quantum mechanics has a number of unintuitive phenomena, some of which can be used model unusual aspects of human behaviour. The application of quantum theory to model human behaviour is wide-ranging. In this chapter we will look at three main areas in which it has been applied. One key area is in how similarity judgements can be modelled. There are a number of phenomena around similarity judgements that are not well modelled using a view of concepts that does not take the state of the observer into account. These include the asymmetry of similarity judgements and the fact that similarity can change depending on other exemplars that are present. Another key area is in judgement and decision-making. Again, puzzling phenomena have been observed regarding the fact that judgements do not follow classical probability theory, known as the conjunction fallacy, can depend crucially on the order in which questions are presented or on the amount of knowledge about the world.

Runtime assertion is challenging in quantum computing for two key reasons. First, a quantum bit (qubit) cannot be copied, which is known as the non-cloning theorem. Second, when a qubit is measured, its superposition state collapses into a classical state, losing the inherent parallel information. In this paper, we overcome these challenges with runtime computation through ancilla qubits, which are used to indirectly collect the information of the qubits of interest.

In this paper, we ask whether other types of computation are possible if we relax one of those characteristics (and keep all others), namely, if we allow wires to be described by d-dimensional Bloch balls, where d is different from three. Theories of this kind have previously been proposed as possible generalizations of quantum physics, and it has been conjectured that some of them allow for interesting multipartite reversible transformations that cannot be realized within quantum theory. However, here we show that all such potential beyond-quantum models of computation are trivial: if d is not three, then the set of reversible transformations consists entirely of single-bit gates, and not even classical computation is possible.

39874000,10.1145/3613424.3614,0,Leakage Suppression; Quantum Error Correction,"Quantum error correction (QEC) codes can tolerate hardware errors by encoding fault-tolerant logical qubits using redundant physical qubits and detecting errors using parity checks. Leakage errors occur in quantum systems when a qubit leaves its computational basis and enters higher energy states. These errors severely limit the performance of QEC due to two reasons. First, they lead to erroneous parity checks that obfuscate the accurate detection of errors. Second, the leakage spreads to other qubits and creates a pathway for more errors over time. Prior works tolerate leakage errors by using leakage reduction circuits (LRCs) that modify the parity check circuitry of QEC codes. Unfortunately, naively using LRCs always throughout a program is sub-optimal because LRCs incur additional two-qubit operations that (1) facilitate leakage transport, and (2) serve as new sources of errors. Ideally, LRCs should only be used if leakage occurs, so that errors from both leakage as well as additional LRC operations are simultaneously minimized. However, identifying leakage errors in real-time is challenging. To enable the robust and efficient usage of LRCs, we propose ERASER that speculates the subset of qubits that may have leaked and only uses LRCs for those qubits. Our studies show that the majority of leakage errors typically impact the parity checks. We leverage this insight to identify the leaked qubits by analyzing the patterns in the failed parity checks. We propose ERASER+M that enhances ERASER by detecting leakage more accurately using qubit measurement protocols that can classify qubits into |0, |1 and |L states. ERASER and ERASER+M improve the logical error rate by up to 4.3 ? and 23 ? respectively compared to always using LRC.  ? 2023 Owner/Author.",ERASER: Towards Adaptive Leakage Suppression for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing,"Proceedings of the 56th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture, MICRO 2023",Vittal S.; Das P.; Qureshi M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 13:56:01,

With the network and communication functionalities provided by the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing (DQC) is considered as a scalable approach for increasing the number of available qubits for computational tasks. For DQC to be effective and efficient, a quantum compiler must find the best partitioning for the quantum algorithm and then perform smart remote operation scheduling to optimize Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair consumption. At the same time, the quantum compiler should also find the best local transformation for each partition. In this article, we present a modular quantum compilation framework for DQC that takes into account both network and device constraints and characteristics. We implemented and tested a quantum compiler based on the proposed framework with some circuits of interest, such as the VQE and QFT ones, considering different network topologies, with quantum processors characterized by heavy-hexagon coupling maps. We also devised a strategy for remote scheduling that can exploit both TeleGate and TeleData operations and tested the impact of using either only TeleGates or both. The evaluation results show that TeleData operations can have a positive impact on the number of consumed EPR pairs, depending on the characteristic of compiled circuit. Meanwhile, choosing a more connected network topology helps reduce the number of layers dedicated to remote operations. ? 2020 IEEE.",A Modular Quantum Compilation Framework for Distributed Quantum Computing,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,Ferrari D.; Carretta S.; Amoretti M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:12:39,

In order to restore individual channels for further processing, these systems require a demultiplexing or channelization approach which can process high data rates with low latency and uses few hardware resources. In this paper, a low latency, adaptable, FPGA-based channelizer using the Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB) signal processing algorithm is presented. As only a single prototype lowpass filter needs to be designed to process all channels, PFBs can be easily adapted to different requirements and further allow for simplified filter design. Due to reutilization of the same filter for each channel they also reduce hardware resource utilization when compared to the traditional Digital Down Conversion approach. The realized system architecture is extensively generic, allowing the user to select from different numbers of channels, sample bit widths and throughput specifications. For a test setup using a 28 coefficient transpose filter and 4 output channels, the proposed architecture yields a throughput of 12.8 Gb/s with a latency of 7 clock cycles. ?

This is achieved by integrating the Complex T-Spherical Fuzzy Set (CTSFS) with the Soft Set (SS). The development of the CTSFSS theory is motivated by the absence of neutral membership in complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft sets and the limitations of Traditional Spherical Fuzzy Soft Sets (TSFSS) in capturing two-dimensional data.

In the 1990s, Peter Shor showed that if scaled quantum computers were to exist, they could be used to efficiently break trap door functions underlying our widely used public key cryptography algorithms (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ECDH). Various US government agencies have issued reports on this concern, including NIST which embarked on a standardization effort to select new algorithms with the help of the cryptography community as of 2016. But while NIST will address the problem of new algorithms, many organizations feel puzzled at the uncertain timeline for PQC and the lack of guidance on the path forward with migration. In this paper, we discuss the problem of PQC readiness from an organization?s point of view, providing recommendations on how to understand the landscape and guidance on what can and should be done in a phased manner. While scaled quantum computing may seem a distant concern, we believe there are good reasons for an organization to start now in developing its understanding of the situation and creating a phased action plan toward PQC readiness. ? 2022 by SCITEPRESS ?

It was only in the last few years that small but functional quantum computers have become available to the broader research community. One paradigm in particular,quantum annealing, can be used to sample optimal solutions for a number of NP-hard optimization problems represented with classical operations research tools, providing an easy access to the potential of this emerging technology. One of the tasks that most naturally fits in this mathematical formulation is feature selection. In this paper, we investigate how to design a hybrid feature selection algorithm for recommender systems that leverages the domain knowledge and behavior hidden in the user interactions data. We represent the feature selection as an optimization problem and solve it on a real quantum computer, provided by D-Wave.

The current mainstream work solves this problem by using multi-node clusters, and we find that its single-node performance has not been effectively exerted. This paper proposes HpQC (High-performance Quantum Computing), a simulator that can efficiently parallel quantum computing on a single-node multi-core processor. First, HpQC used AVX2 and FMA instruction sets to maximize the advantages of SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vectorizations; second, it reduced the CPU calculation cycle by using faster and more efficient bit operations; and finally, we designed innovation data structure to utilize spatial locality of cache effectively.

Since Bob may be truant and pretend to execute some computation, Alice wants to verify Bob?s honesty on computation. To resolve this problem, the notion of the verifiability has been considered in the literature and several protocols of verifiable blind computation have been developed. Verifiable blind quantum computation enables Alice to check whether Bob is cheating or not. In addition to the above problem, another problem could arise. If Alice pretends to be a client and is actually a competitor against Bob, then she might slander Bob by fabricating his dishonesty. Therefore, if either Alice or Bob is cheating, then a ?neutral? referee other than Alice and Bob should judge which is honest. The standard definition of the verifiability guarantees that only Alice can verify Bob?s computation, and thus, it should be called private verifiability. If Bob claims his innocence though he is actually cheating, then Alice cannot persuade any others that Bob is really cheating while Alice can recognize Bob?s cheating. In this paper, we incorporate arbitrators as the third party into blind quantum computation to resolve the above problems and give an arbitrable blind quantum computation scheme, which provides public verifiability in some sense. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Arbitrable blind quantum computation,Quantum Information Processing,Sato G.; Koshiba T.; Morimae T.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:08:23,

The client's goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical - it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter ?, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of ?, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of ?. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.  ? 2021 Owner/Author.",Succinct blind Quantum computation using a random oracle,Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing,Zhang J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 13:49:15,

Despite the potential representative power, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited since their training process proves to be hard. The advent of commercial adiabatic quantum computers (AQCs) raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices can increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. Here, the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs is demonstrated, thanks to an embedding that associates the nodes of the neural networks to virtual qubits. A semantic quantum search is implemented thanks to a reverse annealing schedule. Such an approach exploits more information from the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling algorithm. The semantic training is shown to quickly raise the sampling probability of a subset of the set of the configurations. Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM semantically trained achieves good scores on reconstruction tasks.

Instead of executing the quantum transformation in a single step, they are divided in sub-quantum transformations and only the values different from Identity transformations are stored.

However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges, especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holistic Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and the state-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation application development in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum system to streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combining hybrid quantum?classical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adapting DevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiple well-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloud providers (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket).

39874072,10.1103/PRXQuantum.3,0,,"We reformulate the continuous-space Schr?dinger equation in terms of spin Hamiltonians. For the kinetic energy operator, the critical concept facilitating the reduction in model complexity is the idea of position encoding. A binary encoding of position produces a spin-1/2 Heisenberg-like model and yields exponential improvement in space complexity when compared to classical computing. Encoding with a binary reflected Gray code (BRGC), and a Hamming-distance-2 Gray code (H2GC) reduces the model complexity down to the XZ and transverse Ising model, respectively. For A qubits BRGC yields 2A positions and is reduced to its 2-local form with O(A) ancillary qubits. H2GC yields 2A/2+1 positions with O(A2) three-local penalty terms. We also identify the bijective mapping between diagonal unitaries and the Walsh series, producing the mapping of any real potential to a series of k-local Ising models through the fast Walsh transform. Finally, in a finite volume, we provide some numerical evidence to support the claim that the total time needed for adiabatic evolution is protected by the infrared cutoff of the system. As a result, initial state preparation from a free-field wave function to an interacting system is expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with volume and constant scaling with respect to lattice discretization for all encodings. For H2GC, if the evolution starts with the transverse Hamiltonian due to hardware restrictions, then penalties are dynamically introduced such that the low-lying spectrum reproduces the energy levels of the Laplacian. The adiabatic evolution of the penalty Hamiltonian is therefore sensitive to the ultraviolet scale. It is expected to exhibit polynomial time complexity with lattice discretization, or exponential time complexity with respect to the number of qubits given a fixed volume. ? 2022 authors.

The controllability of the trapped-ion quantum computer enables robust energy estimates using the prepared VQE ansatz states.

39874115,10.1007/978-3-030-64,0,Blind quantum computing; Remote state preparation,"Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (RSPCC), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing RSPCC as a sub-module is unclear. In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner[MR11]. We first identify the goal of RSPCC as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using RSPCC. First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific RSPCC protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al.[BFK09]. However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as RSPCC is used as a subroutine.

To design a reduced quantum circuit that can simulate a high-complexity reference quantum circuit, an optimization should be taken on the number of input quantum states, on the unitary operations of the quantum circuit, and on the number of output measurement rounds. Besides the optimization of the physical layout of the hardware layer, the quantum computer should also solve difficult computational problems very efficiently. To yield a desired output system, a particular objective function associated with the computational problem fed into the quantum computer should be maximized. The reduced gate structure should be able to produce the maximized value of the objective function. These parallel requirements must be satisfied simultaneously, which makes the optimization difficult. Here, we demonstrate a method for designing quantum circuits for gate-model quantum computers and define the Quantum Triple Annealing Minimization (QTAM) algorithm.

With the potential proliferation of universal quantum computers on the horizon, quantum computing, however, is still severely grounded by numerous grave barriers, which lead to its low accessibility and practicality. For example, the vastly different underlying computing models, combined with the steep background knowledge requirements, makes it extremely difficult, if possible at all, for most software engineering researchers and practitioners to even begin to design or implement quantum algorithms or softwares in practice. To overcome this problem, we, in this paper, propose a design that largely circumvents said accessibility and practicality barriers, by providing an end-To-end quantum computing framework for solving NP-complete problems via reduction. We fully implemented a toolkit under our design framework.

Unlike software-based quantum computation simulators, which run on standard general-purpose computers and suffer from reduced performance, this hardware design, which is based on classical concepts of bits, registers and memories, aims to leverage pure parallelism and pipelined execution for efficient quantum computations via emulation. The architecture includes several key components: memories, computation unit, measurement unit and control unit. The quantum state memory stores the individual and group states of qubits. This memory is crucial for maintaining the quantum information required for quantum operations. Basic operators are stored in dedicated operator memory. Additionally, a scratch memory allows for larger operators to be dynamically built at runtime. The computation unit is responsible for performing complex number multiplications, which form the basis of tensor and matrix products necessary for executing quantum operations. A measurement unit enables quantum state sampling, which is an essential aspect of quantum computation. Furthermore, a control unit is incorporated to ensure the correct operation of the quantum processor?s data path. It utilizes a microprogram to manage and coordinate the functional units. All the functional units communicate with each other through dedicated and shared data buses, depending on the frequency of information exchange.

To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users? selection in a ?win?lose? manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ?win?win? manner.

Our project is aimed at introducing MBQC to a wide audience ranging from high school students to quantum computing researchers through a Tangram puzzle with a modified set of rules played on an applet. The player is provided a quantum circuit which they have to map to MBQC using polyominos. Polyominos, the building blocks of our game, consist of square tiles joined edge-to-edge to form different shapes. Each tile represents a measurement basis, differentiated by its color. Polyominos rest on a square-grid playing board, which signifies a cluster state. We show that mapping a quantum circuit to MBQC is equivalent to arranging a set of polyominos - each corresponding to a gate in the circuit - on the playing board, subject to certain rules. We state the rules in simple terms with no reference to quantum computing. One such rule describes ways to deform a polyomino while it still correctly realizes a given quantum gate. The player has to place polyominos on the playing board conforming to the rules. Any correct solution creates a valid realization of the quantum circuit in MBQC. A higher-scoring correct solution fills up less space on the board, resulting in a lower-overhead embedding of the circuit in MBQC, a challenging research problem.  ? 2022 IEEE.",Measurement-Based Quantum Computing as a Tangram Puzzle,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2022",Patil A.; Jacobson Y.; Towsley D.; Guha S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:12:58,

In order to make complex quantum circuits easier and control more qubits, it is necessary to work out mathematical models of new control gates acting on more than three qubits depending on the state of control qubit. Therefore, in this work, mathematical model of multi-qubit universal control gate is worked out and some control gates are formulated in accordance with the proposed model, moreover the tests of these novel control gates are carried out using online open resource or virtual laboratory that is called 'Quirk'.

To implement thermo field dynamics we apply a unitary transformation [1] to discrete quantum mechanical operators to make new Hamiltoni-ans with encoded temperature dependence.

The needed computations in this model are organized as measurement patterns. Previously, an automatic approach to extract a 1WQC pattern from a quantum circuit has been proposed. It takes a quantum circuit consisting of CZ and J(?) gates and translates it into an optimized 1WQC pattern. However, the quantum synthesis algorithms usually decompose circuits using a library containing CNOT and any single-qubit gates. In this paper, we show how this approach can be modified in a way that it can take a circuit consisting of CNOT and any single-qubit gates to produce an optimized 1WQC pattern. The single-qubit gates are first automatically J-decomposed and then added to the measurement patterns. Moreover, a new optimization technique is proposed by presenting some algorithms to add Pauli gates to the measurement patterns directly, i.e., without their J-decomposition which leads to more compact patterns for these gates. Using these algorithms, an improved approach for adding single-qubit gates to measurement patterns is proposed. The optimized pattern of CNOT gates is directly added to the measurement patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can efficiently produce optimized patterns for quantum circuits and that adding CNOT gates directly to the measurement patterns decreases the translation runtime. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Automatic translation of quantum circuits to optimized one-way quantum computation patterns,Quantum Information Processing,Houshmand M.; Saheb Zamani M.; Sedighi M.; Samavatian M.H.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:12:09,

Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between quantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For example, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art metric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor prediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit structure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each program execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that can elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum computer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this article, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically quantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between current success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA determines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum computation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire algorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with well-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success estimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art prediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction error, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above 0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose a promising compiling strategy at compile time.  ? 2020 IEEE.",Quantum Vulnerability Analysis to Guide Robust Quantum Computing System Design,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,Qi F.; Smith K.N.; Lecompte T.; Tzeng N.-F.; Yuan X.; Chong F.T.; Peng L.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 18:16:42,

It stands between computer architecture and mathematics, as it relies strongly on variants of abstract interpretation. One of the features that causes the largest uncertainty regarding WCET evaluation for low-level analysis of sequential execution on a single processor is taking Cache Memory-related Delays (CMRD) and Cache-related Preemption Delays (CRPD) correctly into account. Research work from the 1990s provides a good basic framework for this problem as long as a task runs without preemption. But when preemption of tasks is allowed, although several formalisms exist, their predictive power is lower and the usual approach relies on analyses of NP-hard problems. In this article, we want to show some potential advantages of using a formalism inspired by Quantum Computing (QC) to evaluate CMRDs with preemptions while avoiding the NP-hard problem underneath. The experimental results, with a classic (non-quantum) numerical approach, on a selection of Malardalen benchmark programs display very good accuracy, while the complexity of the evaluation is a low-order polynomial of the number of memory accesses.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75% reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the tool used in a leading QAOA study. ? 2020 Association on Computer Machinery.",Optimal Layout Synthesis for Quantum Computing,"IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, Digest of Technical Papers, ICCAD",Tan B.; Cong J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:36:41,

Two well-known quantum circuit synthesis methods, namely cosine-sine decomposition and quantum Shannon decomposition are considered and then adapted for a library of gates containing CZ and J(?), equipped with optimizations. By exploring the solution space of the combinations of these two methods in a bottom-up approach of dynamic programming, a multiobjective quantum circuit synthesis method is proposed that generates a set of quantum circuits. This approach attempts to simultaneously improve the measurement pattern cost metrics after the translation from this set of quantum circuits. ? 2017 ACM.",Quantum circuit synthesis targeting to improve one-way quantum computation pattern cost metrics,ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems,Houshmand M.; Sedighi M.; Zamani M.S.; Marjoei K.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 14:16:39,

Long-range interactions, however, prevent parallelism of interacting qubit pairs with their surrounding restriction zones. Therefore, the quantum program cannot be run directly on an NA quantum computer (NAQC) unless compiled. The recent compiling study of NAQC applies simple layer-by-layer scheduling and does not consider the difference in gate duration. To address the above issues, we focus on the qubit mapping and quantum gate scheduling (M&S) problem of quantum circuits to meet hardware constraints of superconductivity and even NAs. Our goal is to shorten the execution time to mitigate decoherence noise. We propose a block-game-like abstraction mechanism TETRIS which is an abstract model of the M&S problem and aware of the duration difference of gates and several other NA characteristics. Based on the abstraction, we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm (HGA) to solve the M&S problem efficiently. To further speed up the execution of the circuit, we embed HGA into a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework to solve the M&S problem, which consumes more compiling time but achieves a better result.

One reason for this is the lack of emphasis on edge attributes during massage-passing operations. Another reason is the traditionally shallow nature of graph neural network architectures. Here we introduce an improved message-passing operation that is better equipped to model local kinematics problems such as protein design. Our approach, XENet, pays special attention to both incoming and outgoing edge attributes. We compare XENet against existing graph convolutions in an attempt to decrease rotamer sample counts in Rosetta's rotamer substitution protocol, used for protein side-chain optimization and sequence design. This use case is motivating because it both reduces the size of the search space for classical side-chain optimization algorithms, and allows larger protein design problems to be solved with quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers with limited qubit counts. XENet outperformed competing models while also displaying a greater tolerance for deeper architectures. We found that XENet was able to decrease rotamer counts by 40% without loss in quality. This decreased the memory consumption for classical pre-computation of rotamer energies in our use case by more than a factor of 3, the qubit consumption for an existing sequence design quantum algorithm by 40%, and the size of the solution space by a factor of 165.

Many programmers are familiar with high-level or low-level programming languages but not quantum gates nor the low-level quantum logic required to derive useful results from quantum computers. The steep learning curve involved when progressing from quantum gates to complex simulations such as Shor's algorithm has proven too much for many developers. The purpose of this article and the software presented within addresses this challenge by providing a Software Development Kit (SDK), translation layer, emulator, and a framework of techniques for executing Intel 8080/Z80 assembler on a quantum computer, i.e., all salient points of CPU execution, logic, arithmetic, and bitwise manipulation will be executed on the quantum computer using quantum circuits. This provides a novel means of displaying the equivalency and interoperability of quantum and classical computers. Developers and researchers can use the SDK to write code in Intel 8080/Z80 assembler which is executed locally via traditional emulation and remotely on a quantum computer in parallel. The emulator features side-by-side code execution with visibility of the running quantum circuit and reusable/overridable methods. This enables programmers to learn, reuse, and contrast techniques for performing any traditional CPU-based technique/instruction on a quantum computer, e.g., a programmer may know how to multiply and perform checks on a classical CPU but is not able to perform the same tasks in a quantum implementation, and this SDK allows the programmer to pick and choose the methods they would like to use to fulfil their requirements.

One of the spin qubits is driven by a static magnetic field applied in the direction of the Ising interaction, while the other is coupled with a rotating magnetic field. We also investigate how the entanglement can be controlled by changing the external parameters. Because of the important role of maximally entangled Bell states in quantum communication, we focus on the generalized Bell states as the initial states of the system. It is found that the entanglement evolution is independent of the initial Bell states. Moreover, we can preserve the initial maximal entanglement by adjusting the angular frequency of the rotating field or controlling the exchange coupling between spin qubits. Besides, our calculation shows that the entanglement dynamics is unaffected by the static magnetic field imposed in the direction of the Ising interaction. This is an interesting result, because, as we shall show below, this driving field can be used to control and manipulate the noncyclic geometric phase without affecting the system entanglement. Besides, the nonadiabatic and noncyclic geometric phase for evolved states of the present system are calculated and described in detail. In order to identify the unusable states for quantum communication, completely deviated from the initial maximally entangled states, we also study the fidelity between the initial Bell state and the evolved state of the system. Interestingly, we find that these unusable states can be detected by geometric quantum computation. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Noncyclic geometric quantum computation and preservation of entanglement for a two-qubit Ising model,Quantum Information Processing,Rangani Jahromi H.; Amniat-Talab M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 15:04:37,

When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to performance.

An addressing action causes a stimulated Raman transition, which in turn causes a change in electron spin and thus a qubit rotation.

The hardware platform utilizes waveguides with integrated collimating micro lenses, followed by a cascaded 4f optical setup, consisting of a focusing and a beam expander unit.

This is in contrast to previous protocols, whose overhead in terms of resources employed, while polynomial, is far beyond what is feasible in practice. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit or its input.

However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates.

From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

We construct a new scheme for delegating a large circuit family, which we call ?C+P circuits?. ?C+P? circuits are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates and diagonal gates. Our scheme is non-interactive, requires small amount of quantum computation from the client (proportional to input length but independent of the circuit size), and can be proved secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional assumptions, such as the existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice the random oracle can be replaced by an appropriate hash function or block cipher, for example, SHA-3, AES. This protocol allows a client to delegate the most expensive part of some quantum algorithms, for example, Shor?s algorithm. The previous protocols that are powerful enough to delegate Shor?s algorithm require either many client side quantum operations or the existence of FHE. The protocol requires asymptotically fewer quantum gates on the client side compared to running Shor?s algorithm locally. To hide the inputs, our scheme uses an encoding that maps one input qubit to multiple qubits. We then provide a novel generalization of classical garbled circuits (?reversible garbled circuits?) to allow the computation of Toffoli circuits on this encoding.

In this work, we aim to address these issues. We explicitly define what it means for a quantum algorithm to be distributed and then present various quantum algorithms that fit the definition. We discuss potential benefits and propose a high-level scheme for controlling the system. With this, we present our software framework called Interlin-q, a simulation platform that aims to simplify designing and verifying parallel and distributed quantum algorithms. We demonstrate Interlin-q by implementing some of the discussed algorithms using Interlin-q and layout future steps for developing Interlin-q into a control system for distributed quantum computers.  ? 2021 IEEE.",Quantum Algorithms and Simulation for Parallel and Distributed Quantum Computing,"Proceedings of QCS 2021: 2nd International Workshop on Quantum Computing Software, Held in conjunction with SC 2021: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis",Parekh R.; Ricciardi A.; Darwish A.; Diadamo S.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:20:25,

Indeed, a single photon's image possesses a vast information capacity that can be harnessed for quantum information processing. Our scheme for implementing quantum information processing on a discretized photon wavefront via universal multiport processors employs a class of quantum Fourier optical systems composed of spatial phase modulators and 4f-processors with phase-only pupils having a characteristic periodicity that reduces the number of optical resources quadratically as compared to other conventional path-encoding techniques. In particular, this article employs quantum Fourier optics to implement some key quantum logical gates that can be instrumental in optical quantum computations. For instance, we demonstrate the principle by implementing the single-qubit Hadamard and the two-qubit controlled-not gates via simulation and optimization techniques. Due to various advantages of the proposed scheme, including the large information capacity of the photon wavefront, a quadratically reduced number of optical resources compared with other conventional path-encoding techniques, and dynamic programmability, the proposed scheme has the potential to be an essential contribution to linear optical quantum computing and optical quantum signal processing.  ? 2020 IEEE.",Quantum Computation via Multiport Discretized Quantum Fourier Optical Processors,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,Rezai M.; Salehi J.A.,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 15:41:18,

The conventional TD-FCI wave packet propagation is reproduced using the Jordan-Wigner transformation for wave function and operators and the Trotter product formula for expressing the propagator. In addition, the time-dependent dipole moment, as an example of a time-dependent expectation value, is calculated using the Hadamard test. To include non-Hermitian operators in the ionization dynamics, a similar approach to the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm is employed to translate the propagator, including a complex absorption potential, into quantum gates. The computations are executed on a quantum computer simulator. By construction, all quantum computer algorithms, except for the QITE algorithm used only for ionization but not for excitation dynamics, would scale polynomially on a quantum computer with fully entangled qubits. In contrast, TD-FCI scales exponentially.

However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware.

Using estimated physical parameters for the hardware, we perform a detailed error analysis of measurements and gates, including cnot and Toffoli gates. Having built a realistic noise model, we numerically simulate quantum error correction when the outer code is either a repetition code or a thin rectangular surface code. Our next step toward universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a protocol for fault-tolerant Toffoli magic state preparation that significantly improves upon the fidelity of physical Toffoli gates at very low qubit cost. To achieve even lower overheads, we devise a new magic state distillation protocol for Toffoli states.

At 77 K, the Vth shift (? Vth) in BCAT was larger than that in Peri LVT due to the difference in channel doping concentration. It was observed that only BCAT experienced a decrease in saturation drain current (Id.sat) at cryogenic temperature because of the large ? Vth. To compensate for the ?

Through this connection, outside heat leaks to the qubits and can disrupt their state. Hence, moving the SoC into the cryogenic part eliminates this heat leakage. However, the cooling capacity is limited, requiring a low-power SoC, which, at the same time, has to classify qubit measurements under a tight time constraint.

Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate quantum dynamics with polynomial complexity; however, existing quantum algorithms based on the split-operator techniques require large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers that remain elusive in the near future. Here, we present variational simulations of real-space quantum dynamics suitable for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The Hamiltonian is first encoded onto qubits using a discrete variable representation and binary encoding scheme. We show that direct application of a real-time variational quantum algorithm based on the McLachlan's principle is inefficient as the measurement cost grows exponentially with the qubit number for general potential energy, and an extremely small time-step size is required to achieve accurate results. Motivated by the insights that many chemical dynamics occur in the low-energy subspace, we propose a subspace expansion method by projecting the total Hamiltonian, including the time-dependent driving field, onto the system low-energy eigenstate subspace using quantum computers, and the exact quantum dynamics within the subspace can then be solved classically. We show that the measurement cost of the subspace approach grows polynomially with dimensionality for general potential energy.

To execute a quantum circuit, it is mapped to the quantum computer?s hardware. The resulting compiled circuit strongly influences the precision of the execution in terms of occurring errors caused by used qubits and quantum gates. Selecting an optimal one is, therefore, essential. SDKs are used to implement circuits and differ in supported cloud providers and programming languages. These differences complicate a change to other backends. In previous work, we developed an automated framework to translate a given circuit and compile it on available quantum computers using multiple compilers. The compilation results can be prioritized and executed. Nevertheless, the translation and compilation with all compilers and quantum computers is resource-intensive and does not scale well with further backends in the future.

Today, the dominant method to erase the qubit state is a full system wipe, which effectively resets all the qubits at the same time. In today's superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example, a full system wipe takes up to 1000 ?s, and it fully erases all information in the system. However, with a full system wipe there is no means for only a few qubits to be cleared and assigned to a new user or program; everything has to be erased at the same time. A secure reset operation could allow resetting only a subset of qubits, and it could be built upon existing (insecure) reset operation available from superconducting qubit machines from IBM, for example. The (insecure) reset operation is available today, which can be used to reset the state of a qubit in a time on the order of 10 ?s down to 1 ?s. The reset operation is thus much faster than a full system wipe. However, as this work demonstrates, it is possible to leak some information across the (insecure) reset operation as it does not perfectly reset the qubit state between two users or programs who may be sequentially scheduled on the same qubit. Further, crosstalk-like effects are observed where reset behavior of one qubit can be inferred from an adjacent qubit. This work analyzes the existing (insecure) reset operation in order to understand how a secure reset operation could be built upon it. This work then describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed secure reset operation which can reset qubits without leaking information, and retains a factor of 300 speedup over a full system?wipe. ? 2022 Owner/Author.",Securing Reset Operations in NISQ Quantum Computers,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,Mi A.; Deng S.; Szefer J.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 2:22:29,

The DAC operates at a sampling frequency of 1 MHz and can replicate constant, sinusoidal, rectangular, and triangular signals within a full-scale (FS) range of ?0.9V and a resolution of 500 ?V. To mitigate ion shaking in the trap, a low pass filter minimizes glitch errors at major output code transitions and a spectral noise density (SND) of 45.3nV/VHz has been measured at 100 kHz. Implemented in a 130 nm high-voltage (HV) bulk CMOS technology, the DAC consumes 1.1 m W from a 1.5 V power supply at room temperature (RT). This includes a reference buffer and a serial peripheral interface (SPI) to read in the DAC control words. The whole circuitry takes up an active area of 1200 x 700 ?m2 excluding pads.

To overcome these computational barriers, quantum computers, which are based on principles of quantum mechanics were introduced. Faster computation is the main reason behind the evolution of quantum computers which is achieved by using quantum bits instead of bits as quantum bits store both the values 1 and 0 together in superposition. The article focuses on basics of quantum computing in brief and the underlying phenomenon behind quantum computers. Also this article exposes recent trends and the problems that are being faced in this quantum technology. The major impact of quantum machine learning is also discussed.

The Security of Quantum Key Distribution lies in the Laws of Quantum Mechanics and is recognized to be one of the most secure cryptography ever known. The major advantage of Position-Based Key Distribution is that an authenticated server or device will be able to use its InterSpace Positions while authenticating in an environment while exchanging a secure key for communication over the network. In Position Cryptography the Authentication is done by verifying that a particular Device holds a definite and fixed position in Space-Time. In this paper, we proposed the experimental Time-Based Attack which evolved as modern day Decoy-Fake Shift Attack. The key idea is: an Attacker Eve can change the Shift of the Key randomly to T1 or T2 with the probability of shift, F and G = 1-F respectively. Also, the attacker can Authenticate and Randomize the Probability F in such a way so that it ensures the Receiver's Detection Ratio is constant i.e. 1:1. So, as a result, the two parties communicating via a secure Quantum channel will not be able to detect the Eavesdropping caused by the attacker and therefore the attacker can have an Authentication over the shared key and can, therefore, the parties will not be able to conceal its information. Thus the secure Position Quantum Cryptography can be broken by this proposed Architecture model. In this paper, we represented the Architecture Model experimentally and the Security Analysis for such an attack has been proposed. ? 2017 IEEE.",Quantum computation of perfect time-eavesdropping in position-based quantum cryptography: Quantum computing and eavesdropping over perfect key distribution,"2017 8th Industrial Automation and Electromechanical Engineering Conference, IEMECON 2017",Gupta S.; Sau K.; Pramanick J.; Pyne S.; Ahamed R.; Biswas R.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:48:18,

De novo metabolite identification is an identification strategy that does not refer to any spectral or metabolite database. However, this strategy is time-consuming and cannot meet the need for high-throughput metabolite identification. B?cker et al. converted the de novo identification problem into the maximum colorful subtree (MCS) problem. Unfortunately, the MCS problem is NP-hard, which indicates there are no existing efficient exact algorithms. To address this issue, we propose to apply quantum computing to accelerate metabolite identification. Quantum computing performs computations on quantum computers. The recent progress in this area has brought the hope of making some computationally intractable areas trackable, although there are still no general approaches to converting regular computer algorithms into quantum algorithms. Specifically, there is no efficient quantum algorithm for the MCS problem. This study explores the feasibility of integrating quantum computing into de novo metabolite identification. The MCS problem can be considered as the combination of many maximum spanning tree problems that can be converted into minimum spanning tree problems. This work applies a quantum algorithm designed for the minimum spanning problem to speed up de novo metabolite identification. Applying quantum computing to solve bioinformatics problems is challenging. It requires knowledge of several areas, such as computer science, quantum computing, and biology. However, conducting this type of research will help students build an interdisciplinary mindset. Therefore, we attempt to design an undergraduate research project for applying quantum computing to identify metabolites without referring to any database. This project provides opportunities for undergraduate students to learn computer programing, algorithm design, quantum computing, quantum algorithm design, and de novo metabolite identification. After students are familiar with these areas, they are guided to identify the potential ways of solving the identification problem by converting problems and searching literature. B?cker et al. have converted the original identification problem into the maximum spanning tree problem. While there is no existing quantum algorithm for the maximum spanning tree problem, there is an existing quantum algorithm for the minimum spanning tree problem. Students find a simple way to convert the maximum spanning tree problem into the minimum spanning tree problem.

More specifically, it introduces three systems that render sounds from the results of processing photons using Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS). Essentially, a GBS algorithm normally includes three modules: squeezers, interferometers and photon detectors. In a nutshell, the squeezers prepare the inputs, the interferometer operates on the inputs, and the photon detectors produce the results. Pulses of laser light are input to an array of squeezers. What a squeezer does is crush light into a bunch of photons in a state of superposition, referred to as a squeezed state. Next, squeezed states are relayed to the interferometer. The interferometer provides a network of beam splitters and phase shifters, which are programmed with operations to manipulate the photons. The interferometer is expected to produce highly entangled quantum states encoding the processed quantum information. These are subsequently channelled to detectors that count how many photons are within each stream of squeezed states. The results of the computation are encoded in the statistics of this photon counting. The photon-counting data are used as control parameters for bespoke sound synthesizers. ?

In this framework, a sustainable computation offloading strategy is obtained while guaranteeing the individual latency constraints and the required success ratio for each computation task. More precisely, the original latency minimization problem is transformed into a stepwise mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem using Lyapunov techniques. Subsequently, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) is adopted for computation offloading mode selection.

Specifically, we simulate gates and syndrome measurements on a single qubit of information encoded into the [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code and determine the output state fidelity as a function of the accuracy with which Shor states (for syndrome measurements) and magic states (to implement T-gates) are constructed. When no syndrome measurements are applied during the gate sequence, we observe that the fidelity increases after performance of a T-gate and improving magic states construction slows the fidelity decay rate. In contrast, when syndrome measurements are applied, loss of fidelity occurs primarily after the syndrome measurements taken after a T-gate. Improving magic state construction slows the fidelity decay rate, and improving Shor state construction raises the initial fidelity but does not slow the fidelity decay rate. Along the way, we show that applying syndrome measurements after every gate does not maximize the output state fidelity. Rather, syndrome measurements should be applied sparingly. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Improving ancilla states for quantum computation,Quantum Information Processing,Weinstein Y.S.; Chai D.; Xie N.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 2:10:58,

For the sake of ultra-fast reading, it requires the signal readout time is less than 10-5 s at a temperature lower than 30K in the cryogenic quantum computing. However, the bulk resistance of MCP multiplier became giant at cryogenic temperature for the property of huge negative temperature coefficient of resistance, almost 105 Gohm at 20K?30K, resulting in a readout time of 10-2-1s at cryogenic temperature, which was one of the major bottlenecks for the application of MCPs in the cryogenic quantum computing.

However, in spite of these achievements in quantum technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ devices.

In the classical setting, the generic complexity to find collisions of an n-bit hash function is O(2n/2), thus classical collision attacks based on differential cryptanalysis such as rebound attacks build differential trails with probability higher than 2-n/2. By the same analogy, generic quantum algorithms such as the BHT algorithm find collisions with complexity O(2n/3). With quantum algorithms, a pair of messages satisfying a differential trail with probability p can be generated with complexity p-1/2. Hence, in the quantum setting, some differential trails with probability up to 2-2n/3 that cannot be exploited in the classical setting may be exploited to mount a collision attack in the quantum setting. In particular, the number of attacked rounds may increase. In this paper, we attack two international hash function standards: AES-MMO and Whirlpool. For AES-MMO, we present a 7-round differential trail with probability 2-80 and use it to find collisions with a quantum version of the rebound attack, while only 6 rounds can be attacked in the classical setting. For Whirlpool, we mount a collision attack based on a 6-round differential trail from a classical rebound distinguisher with a complexity higher than the birthday bound. This improves the best classical attack on 5 rounds by 1. We also show that those trails are optimal in our approach. Our results have two important implications. First, there seems to exist a common belief that classically secure hash functions will remain secure against quantum adversaries. Indeed, several second-round candidates in the NIST post-quantum competition use existing hash functions, say SHA-3, as quantum secure ones. Our results disprove this common belief. Second, our observation suggests that differential trail search should not stop with probability 2-n/2 but should consider up to 2-2n/3. Hence it deserves to revisit the previous differential trail search activities. ?

A quantum computer comprises a cryogenic quantum processor and a classical electronic controller. When scaling up the cryogenic quantum processor to at least a few thousands, and possibly millions, of qubits required for any practical quantum algorithm, cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics is required to allow feasible and compact interconnections between the controller and the quantum processor. Cryo-CMOS leverages the CMOS fabrication infrastructure while exploiting the continuous improvement of performance and miniaturization guaranteed by Moore's law, in order to enable the fabrication of a cost-effective practical quantum computer. However, designing cryo-CMOS integrated circuits requires a new set of CMOS device models, their embedding in design and verification tools, and the possibility to co-simulate the cryo-CMOS/quantum-processor architecture for full-system optimization. In this paper, we address these challenges by focusing on their impact on the design of complex cryo-CMOS systems. ? 2017 ACM.",Cryo-CMOS Electronic Control for Scalable Quantum Computing: Invited,Proceedings - Design Automation Conference,Sebastiano F.; Homulle H.; Patra B.; Incandela R.; Van Dijk J.; Song L.; Babaie M.; Vladimirescu A.; Charbon E.,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 21:54:25,

Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using realsystem measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate 'quantum supremacy,' i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Noise-Adaptive Compiler Mappings for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers,International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS,Murali P.; Baker J.M.; Abhari A.J.; Chong F.T.; Martonosi M.,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 1:41:37,

It is one of the important directions for the leapfrog development of computing power in the future. However, due to the limitation of the number of quantum bits, coherence time, fidelity and other factors, the computing power of quantum computers has not been fully utilized at the current stage. In recent years, researchers have proposed a variety of quantum computing performance benchmarks to evaluate and research the performance of quantum computers from the bit, circuit, system, application and other levels. However, the existing performance benchmarks cannot directly evaluate the ability of quantum computers to solve specific problems.

It leads to an exponential growth of the computational complexity of even most elementary quantum mechanical calculations, not to mention more advanced computational tasks, such as the ones required for studying the metrological potential of quantum states, e.g. computation of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Solution method: Thanks to the use of the tensor-network formalism, where quantum states are represented as matrix product states and operators as matrix product operators, it is possible to obtain an efficient description where space complexity scales linearly with the number of elementary particles constituting the physical system. Furthermore, it is possible to efficiently optimize QFI over quantum states and operators in those representations, applying the ideas presented in [1]. This allows to study sophisticated quantum metrological models that are beyond the grasp of the standard numerical methods utilizing the full Hilbert space representation of quantum states and operations.

Due to the demand of improvement with respect to the computational methods in this area and the recent development in quantum computation field, there exists an opportunity to closely relate these two areas.

Multi-programming is enticing for quantum cloud providers as it can maximize device utilization, throughput, and profit for clouds. Users can also benefit from the short wait queue.

The method computes the order r of a random element x in the group Z(N)* and uses that information for splitting N with an application of the greatest common divisor algorithm. However, being probabilistic, the success of Shor's algorithm relies on some special properties of N. If r is even and x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N, then gcd(x(r/2) - 1, N) reveals a nontrivial factor of N and the method succeeds. But even assuming that r is even and being given the complete prime factorization of N it is not obvious whether x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N and, therefore, it is not easy to assert whether Shor's algorithm would split N without running it and looking at its answer. We present a strategy for detecting whether the splitting occurs without any need for running the quantum order-finding algorithm, but we must be given the prime factorization of N. This has allowed us to produce the first direct evidence of the probability of success of Shor's method.

QuCAT uses two test oracles to check the correctness of test outputs. We assess the cost and effectiveness of QuCAT with 3 faulty versions of 5 quantum programs.

We show that a quantum computer can find high quality values of intra-layer connections and weights, while yielding a tractable time result as the complexity of the network increases; a high performance computer can find optimal layer-based topologies; and a neuromorphic computer can represent the complex topology and weights derived from the other architectures in low power memristive hardware. This represents a new capability that is not feasible with current von Neumann architecture. It potentially enables the ability to solve very complicated problems unsolvable with current computing technologies.","A Study of Complex Deep Learning Networks on High Performance, Neuromorphic, and Quantum Computers","DOE Office of Science User Facility(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE))",Potok and  TE; Schuman and  CD; Young and  SR; Patton and  RM; Spedalieri and  F; Liu and  J; Yao and  KT; Rose and  G; Chakma and  G,,o,,1,2024-02-18 19:48:28,

In the proposed HMCFQDE, a new hybrid mutation strategy based on the advantages of local neighborhood mutation and SaNSDE is designed. In the early stage of the search, the local neighborhood mutation strategy with high search efficiency is used to speed up the algorithm convergence. In the later stage of the search, the SaNSDE algorithm is used to adjust the search direction in order to avoid the search stagnation. The QEA is combined with the DE to make use of the quantum chromosome encoding to enhance the population diversity, the quantum rotation to speed up the convergence speed. The CC framework is used to divide the large-scale and high-dimensional complex optimization problem into several low-dimensional optimization sub-problems, and these sub-populations are solved by independent searching among sub-populations in order to improve the solution efficiency. By comparing with other 6 algorithms in solving 6 test functions from CEC'08 under the dimensions of 100, 500 and 1000, it is proved that the proposed HMCFQDE has higher convergence accuracy and stronger stability. In particular, it has a strong ability to optimize high-dimensional complex functions. Therefore, it provides a new method for solving large-scale optimization problem. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In order to resist attacks from ignoring identity authentication in BQC protocols, it is necessary to guarantee the legality of both clients and servers in a multi-party BQC network. So we propose a multi-party BQC protocol involving three phases to distribute shared keys and authenticate identities. Firstly, by using the advantages of measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), the registered client and the assigned server could share the initial key safely in registration phase. Secondly, with the help of semi-honest certificate authority (CA), mutual identity authentication phase realizes the two-way authentication from both sides through the shared key simultaneously. Thirdly, in the blind quantum computing phase, a registered client can complete his computing task by just measuring the qubits from the assigned server rather than preparing the qubits. Moreover, combined with first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, clients' authentication and blind quantum computing can be processed in parallel. The protocol can also be applied in other multi-party BQC protocols with the universality of resource states.

Diagonal sub-matrices contain information on single robots; off-diagonal sub-matrices are the pairwise interaction terms. Comparing different swarms means comparing different block matrices. Choosing initial values and computation rules for off-diagonal blocks (with a particular logic gate), different behaviors can be modeled.

However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e., graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present. In this paper, we revisit the basics of quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as graph-based).

The present state of quantum programming reminds us of how Classical Computing was about 70 years ago when computing machines such as the ENIAC required significant effort to program solely using very basic digital building blocks. Over the decades, though, increasingly higher-level abstractions have been created on top of the basic building blocks of Classical Computing and made computation much more accessible and wide-spread. In order to make Quantum Computing more accessible, we argue that Software Engineering for QC needs to embark on a similar journey and create abstractions that shield developers from the basic QC building blocks as much as possible so that they can focus their attention on solving problems and less on how to manipulate quantum states using quantum circuits.

Then, we demonstrate that it is possible for the quantum interference terms to appear in the trust decision making process. By using the interference terms, we can quantify the emotions and subjective preferences of the trustor in various contexts with different amounts of uncertainty and risk. The non-commutative nature of quantum probabilities is a valuable mathematical tool to model the relative nature of trust. In relative trust models, the evaluation of a trustee candidate is not only dependent on the trustee itself, but on the other existing competitors. In other words, the first evaluation is performed in an isolated context whereas the rest of the evaluations are performed in a comparative one. It is shown that a QDT-based model of trust can account for these order effects in the trust decision making process. Finally, based on the principles of risk and uncertainty aversion, interference alternation theorem and interference quarter law, quantitative values are assigned to interference terms.

An attacker can inject false messages to a vehicle's CAN via wireless communication, the infotainment system, or the onboard diagnostic port. Thus, an effective intrusion detection system is essential to distinguish authentic CAN messages from false ones. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework using a classical neural network (NN) and a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The classical NN is dedicated to feature extraction from CAN images generated from a vehicle's CAN bus data. In contrast, the quantum RBM is dedicated to CAN image reconstruction for classification-based intrusion detection. The novelty of the study lies in utilizing the generative ability of an RBM to reconstruct the pixels in a CAN image, a portion of which is dedicated to labeling. Then, that portion of the reconstructed image is used to classify the image as an attack image or a normal image. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework, we used a real-world CAN fuzzy attack dataset to create three separate attack datasets, where each dataset represents a unique set of features related to the vehicle.

Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC.

Quantum telecloning is a protocol that originates from a combination of quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. Here we present 1 -> 2 and 1 -> 3 quantum telecloning circuits, with and without ancilla, that are theoretically optimal (meaning the clones have the highest fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics), universal (meaning the clone fidelity is independent of the state being cloned), and symmetric (meaning the clones all have the same fidelity). We implement these circuits on gate model IBMQ and Quantinuum NISQ hardware and quantify the clone fidelities using parallel single qubit state tomography. Quantum telecloning using mid-circuit measurement with classical feedforward control (i.e. real time if statements) is demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-2 device. Two alternative implementations of quantum telecloning, deferred measurement and post selection, are demonstrated on ibmq_montreal, where mid-circuit measurements with real time if statements are not available. Our results show that NISQ devices can achieve near-optimal quantum telecloning fidelity; for example the Quantinuum H1-2 device running the telecloning circuits without ancilla achieved a mean clone fidelity of 0.824 with standard deviation of 0.024 for two clone circuits and 0.765 with standard deviation of 0.022 for three clone circuits.

These mechanisms assist QuPAA to generate instructions adaptively and reduce the requirement for coherence time and instruction bandwidth. The evaluation results show that, compared to the baseline quantum computer with a single AWG unit, QuPAA reduces 25.9% to 97.4% coherence time requirement, and saves 26.9% to 79.1% instruction bandwidth.

It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel opensource framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm.

Simulation of these systems is very relevant to develop and test new quantum algorithms. In order to overcome the increase in simulation complexity, this work presents reduction and decomposition optimizations for the Distributed Geometric Machine environment. By exploring properties as the sparsity of the Identity operator and partiality of dense unitary transformations, better storage and distribution of quantum information are achieved. The main improvements are reached by decreasing replication and void elements inherited from quantum operators. In the evaluation of this proposal, Hadamard transformations from 21 to 28 qubits and Quantum Fourier Transforms from 26 to 28 qubits were simulated over CPU, sequentially and in parallel, and in graphics processing unit, showing reduced temporal complexity and, consequently, shorter simulation time.

A primary limiting factor is classical-to-quantum (C2Q) data encoding, which requires specific circuits for quantum state initialization. The required state initialization circuits are often complex and violate decoherence constraints, particularly for I/O intensive applications. Existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are noise-sensitive and have low quantum bit (qubit) counts, thus limiting the applicability of C2Q circuits for encoding large and realistic datasets. This has made the study of complete and realistic circuits that include data encoding challenging and has also led to a heavy dependency on costly and resource-intensive simulations on classical platforms. In this work, we propose a cost-effective, classical-hardware-accelerated framework for realistic and complete emulation of quantum algorithms. The emulation framework incorporates components for the critical C2Q data encoding process, as well as architectures for quantum algorithms such as the quantum Haar transform (QHT). The framework is used to investigate optimizations for C2Q and QHT algorithms, and the corresponding optimized quantum circuits are presented. The framework is implemented on a High-Performance Reconfigurable Computer (HPRC) which emulates the proposed QHT circuits combined with proposed C2Q data encoding methods. For performance benchmarks, CPU-based emulations and simulations on a state-of-the-art quantum computing simulator are also carried out.

We show that a direct discretization of the Schrodinger equation by central finite differences leads to a non-symmetric Hamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of such matrices is more complex it is advantageous to transform it in a symmetric form. This can be done by the Liouville-like transformation proposed by Rizea et al. (2008), which replaces the wave function psi(rho) with the function F(rho) = psi(rho)root rho and transforms the Hamiltonian accordingly. Even though a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is produced by this procedure, the computed wave functions are found to be inaccurate near the origin, and the accuracy of the energy levels is not very high. In order to improve on this, we devised a finite-difference scheme which discretizes the Schrodinger equation in the first step, and then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the difference equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix, resulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite element method. The superior efficiency of the new finite-difference scheme (FDM) is demonstrated for a few p-dependent one-dimensional potentials which are usually employed to model the electron states in free-standing and core shell quantum wires. The new scheme is compared with the other FDM schemes for solving the effective-mass Schrodinger equation, and is found to deliver energy levels with much smaller numerical error for all the analyzed potentials. It also gives more accurate results than the scheme of Rizea et al., except for the ground state of an infinite rectangular potential in freestanding quantum wires. Moreover, the PT symmetry is invoked to explain similarities and differences between the considered FDM schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This scientific direction is currently relevant, since it is related to the problem of security and data protection in current information and communication networks. The article is devoted to quantum cryptography; it describes the development of quantum protocols as quantum key distribution systems. Grounded on the laws of quantum mechanics, the elaboration of modifications of secure data transfer protocols is shown. The authors considered the best-known protocol to be BB84 of quantum key distribution; a more modern modification of this protocol is BB84 Info-Z. Comparative analysis of these has also been carried out. It has been established that the BB84-Info-Z quantum protocol works more efficiently than BB84 since its lower error threshold allows the interceptor to obtain much less information about the secret key. The authors put forward a new idea to improve the BB84 protocol (which has been quite outdated for almost 40 years), due to the increase in modern requirements for quantum cryptography protocols. The modification is called CSLOE-2022. It enables significant intensification of cryptographic strength and the entanglement degree of the interceptor (cryptanalyst), which greatly complicates the very possibility of intercepting information. The ultimate goal of the CSLOE-2022 modification is to complicate the eavesdropping process so much that it can be considered completely useless for an attacker in terms of wasting time and resources. The modification allows exceeding the known speed limit of key generation without repeaters since it uses two sources, the phases of which, in addition to the hundreds of kilometers of fiber between them, are very difficult to stabilize. Comparison of the protocols by working distance showed that for BB84, this distance does not exceed 70 km; for BB84-Info-Z it is similar, at no more than 70 km, and the modification of CSLOE-2022 proposed by the authors theoretically allows increasing the working distance of the quantum protocol to 511 km (7.3 times).","Development of Quantum Protocol Modification CSLOE-2022, Increasing the Cryptographic Strength of Classical Quantum Protocol BB84",,Cherckesova and  LV; Safaryan and  OA; Beskopylny and  AN; Revyakina and  E,,o,,-1,2024-02-19 1:36:26,

In this work, we propose and compare multilevel segmentation approaches based on classical and quantum techniques. The Classical Renyi (CR) and the Quantum Renyi (QR) entropies are used to quantify the information contained in the image. Within the quantum framework, the digital image is expressed as a quantum system by means of the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI). Generally, the multilevel thresholding formulation leads to a complex optimization problem. The Classical Genetic Algorithm (CGA) and the Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) are employed to efficiently determine the optimal thresholding values by maximizing the entropy-based fitness functions.

This has enabled people to have at least 1 smartphone in general with this number increasing exponentially. However, the increasing use of these mobile devices results in an equal increase in the underused processing capacity of these devices too. This encourages the research aiming to use this processing power by forming a mobile computational grid. Because of the inherent limitations of bandwidth, battery, and computational power, job scheduling on these devices demands an efficient scheduling approach to harness the true potential of the grid. The problem becomes even more challenging considering the dynamic nature of these mobile devices. Job scheduling being nondeterministic polynomial time-complete allows the use of evolutionary approaches by exploring and exploiting the search space efficiently. The exploration gets boosted even more with the use of quantum-computing concepts.

Existing programming models for QC were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind, envisioning stand-alone applications. However, the susceptibility of nearterm quantum computers to noise limits their stand-alone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This modus operandi calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension specification, called QCOR, which enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the QCOR library-based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables. After defining QCOR's programming model, memory model, and execution model, we discuss how QCOR enables variational, iterative, and feed-forward QC.

Unfortunately, physical quantum devices are highly susceptible to errors that limit us from running most of these quantum applications. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are required to implement Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQC) on which computations can be performed without encountering errors. Error decoding is a critical component of quantum error correction and is responsible for transforming a set of qubit measurements generated by the QEC code, called the syndrome, into error locations and error types. For the feasibility of implementation, error decoders must not only identify errors with high accuracy, but also be fast and scalable to a large number of qubits. Unfortunately, most of the prior works on error decoding have focused primarily only on the accuracy and have relied on software implementations that are too slow to be of practical use. Furthermore, these studies only look at designing a single decoder and do not analyze the challenges involved in scaling the storage and bandwidth requirements when performing error correction in large systems with thousands of qubits. In this paper, we present AFS, an accurate, fast, and scalable decoder architecture that is designed to operate in the context of systems with hundreds of logical qubits. We present the hardware implementation of AFS, which is based on the Union Find decoding algorithm and employs a three-stage pipelined design. AFS provides orders of magnitude higher accuracy compared to recent SFQ-based hardware decoders (logical error rate of 6 x 10(-10) for physical error rate of 10(-3)) and low decoding latency (42ns on average), while being robust to measurement errors introduced while extracting syndromes during the QEC cycles. We also reduce the amount of decoding hardware required to perform QEC simultaneously on all the logical qubits by co-designing the micro-architecture across multiple decoding units. Our proposed Conjoined-Decoder Architecture (CDA) reduces the storage overhead by 70% (10MB to 2.8MB). Finally, we reduce the bandwidth overheads required to transmit syndromes from the qubits to the decoders by exploiting the sparsity in the syndromes and compressing the data.

To make a quantum circuit effectively executable, a circuit transformation process is necessary to transform it, with overhead cost the smaller the better, into a functionally equivalent one so that the connectivity constraints imposed by the quantum processing unit are satisfied. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this goal, the overhead costs are often very high, which degenerates the fidelity of the obtained circuits sharply. One major reason for this lies in that, due to the high branching factor and vast search space, almost all of these algorithms only search very shallowly, and thus, very often, only (at most) locally optimal solutions can be reached. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to tackle the circuit transformation problem, which enables the search process to go much deeper. The general framework supports implementations aiming to reduce either the size or depth of the output circuit through introducing SWAP or remote CNOT gates. The algorithms, called MCTS-Size and MCTS-Depth, are polynomial in all relevant parameters. Empirical results on extensive realistic circuits and IBM Q Tokyo show that the MCTS-based algorithms can reduce the size (respectively, depth) overhead by, on average, 66% (respectively, 84%) when compared with t broken vertical bar ket >, an industrial-level compiler.",Quantum Circuit Transformation: A Monte Carlo Tree Search Framework,National Key R&D Program of China; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Foundation of China (CN),Zhou and  XZ; Feng and  Y; Li and  SJ,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 17:31:37,

To prevent a violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another. However, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be implemented by LOBC with \epsilon -error using {O}(\log (1/\epsilon)) entangled bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as {O}(1/\epsilon) . We also consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions {d}_{A}\otimes {d}_{B} . We find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of \log {d}_{B} ebits is shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even when {d}_{A}=2 . This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs of LOCC and LOBC gate implementation. Whereas previous lower bounds on the entanglement cost for instantaneous nonlocal computation restrict the minimum dimension of the needed entanglement, we bound its entanglement entropy. To our knowledge this is the first such lower bound of its kind.",Bounds on Instantaneous Nonlocal Quantum Computation,Office of Naval Research Award(Office of Naval Research); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Physics(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),Gonzales and  A; Chitambar and  E,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 16:44:19,

In this paper, a novel neural networks model called quantum local potential function networks (QLPFNs) is proposed.

The local potential functions form the basic components of the QLPFN structure, which are automatically generated from the subsets of training data following specific subspace division procedures. Therefore, the QLPFN model in fact incorporates the level of data concentration as a computation technique, which is different from the classical RBFN model that exhibits radial symmetry toward specific centers.

However, with the rapid increase in technology and population, the task of examining the patient becomes cumbersome and sometimes human efforts produce inconsistent results. Several research is being done for healthcare in terms of improving visualization and accuracy by using machine learning models. The current research targets to explore quantum computing as a different way of processing information compared to classical computer systems such as the use of quantum bits (qubits) along with superposition and entanglement for extending the computation capabilities at an unprecedented level of thinking in the healthcare domain. Quantum computing systems provide exponential benefits in terms of high-speed processing, faster and easier diagnostic assistance, unimaginable reduction in processing throughput, and many more. An extensive comparative analysis of existing approaches has been made which benchmarks the need for quantum healthcare computing. The objective of this work is to interpret whether Quantum computers prove to be more trusted when it comes to patient diagnosis, and faster analysis leading to cost optimization. In order to accelerate patient diagnosis, different approaches have been presented. The authors have proposed a precision-based granular approach for patient diagnosis that incorporates diagnosing the disease with enhanced precision and granularity. It involves reporting symptoms by the patient, encountering by healthcare expert on multiple factors, precise examination, granular health status (understanding past and present medical history), followed by a precise intervention by understanding biomolecular simulations. The algorithm has been presented to describe the flow process for patient diagnosis modeling using quantum computing. It involves qubits initialization, pairing the values, assigning probabilistic values, cross validation, and quantum circuit formation. Precision-based granular approach has been implemented for a scenario (consisting of medical parameters such as oxygen and heart rate level, with the functionality of diagnosing oxygen level and heart range which lies as either normal or not normal (high/low)). Precision-based granular approach deals specifically with the individual 'biomolecular simulation by understanding variations in the individual body whereas the umbrella-based approach does not deal with specifically to individual mechanisms. Granular level of encounter is not possible in umbrella-based treatment. Python Jupyter notebook and IBM Composer tool is used for the implementation of results. Bloch sphere and computational state graph are obtained as an output for better visualization and understanding. Falcon r5.11H processor is used with the version of 1.0.24 of IBM Composer to simulate the experiment. The methodology using precision based granular approach provides timely encounter of disease along with umbrella diagnosis and precise treatment.

Previous work addresses the difficulty by utilizing multiple Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and multi-node computers. GPUs are efficient for handling runtime issues but have limited total accessible memory space. Meanwhile, the memory of a multi-node computer can be scaled to the petabytes order, but its bandwidth for access from host computers (CPUs) is narrow. To simultaneously accelerate simulation and enlarge the total memory space, we propose a heterogeneous parallelization approach by combining GPUs and CPUs. Our simulator allocates memory to the GPUs first, and then to the CPUs. It thus accelerates simulation by using the full capabilities of the GPUs if memory for the simulation fits in the GPUs on a cluster. Allocating memory to the CPUs reduces benefits of the GPUs but enlarges the capacity of qubits in the simulation. In such case, it can exploit the memory of the GPUs to add one more qubit in the simulation if the size of memory in a node is the power of two (such as 512GB).

To this end, we study the six elementary pseudo-Boolean optimization problems OneMax, LeadingOnes, Discrepancy, Needle, Jump, and TinyTrap. It turns out that the advantage of the respective quantum search heuristic over its classical counterpart varies with the problem structure and ranges from no speedup at all for the problem Discrepancy to exponential speedup for the problem TinyTrap.

Recently, the use of graphs in application domains such as routing, network analysis and resource allocation has become crucial. In these areas, graphs are often evolving in time: for example, connection links may fail due to temporary technical issues, meaning that edges of the graph cannot be traversed for some time interval and alternative paths have to be followed. In classical computation, where graphs are represented as adjacency matrices or lists, these problems are well studied and ad-hoc visit procedures have been developed. For specific problems quantum computation, through superpositions and entanglement has provided faster algorithms than their classical counterpart.

(2) We design X-SWAP scheme that enables inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated with critical gates to reduce the SWAP overheads. (3) We propose a compilation task scheduler that schedules concurrent quantum programs to be compiled and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. We evaluate our work on publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated quantum chip IBMQ50. Our work outperforms the state-of-the-art work for multi-programming on fidelity and compilation overheads by 9.7% and 11.6%, respectively.",QuCloud: A New Qubit Mapping Mechanism for Multi-programming Quantum Computing in Cloud Environment,NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Liu and  L; Dou and  XL,,o,,1,2024-02-23 14:13:33,

This paper studies a notion of MPC that allows some classical and some quantum parties to securely compute a quantum functionality over their joint private inputs. In particular, we construct constant-round composable protocols for blind and verifiable classical delegation of quantum computation, and give applications to secure quantum computation with classical communication. Assuming QLWE (the quantum hardness of learning with errors), we obtain the following (maliciously-secure) protocols for computing any BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial-time) functionality. - A six-round protocol between one quantum server and multiple classical clients in the CRS (common random string) model. - A three-round protocol between one quantum server and multiple classical clients in the PKI (public-key infrastructure) + QRO (quantum random oracle) model. - A two-message protocol between quantum sender and classical receiver (a quantum non-interactive secure computation protocol), in the QRO model. To enable composability of classical verification of quantum computation, we require the notion of malicious blindness, which stipulates that the prover does not learn anything about the verifier's delegated computation, even if it is able to observe whether or not the verifier accepted the proof. To construct a protocol with malicious blindness, we use a classical verification protocol for sampBQP computation (Chung et al., Arxiv 2020), which in general has inverse polynomial soundness error, to prove honest evaluation of QFHE (quantum fully-homomorphic encryption) ciphertexts with negligible soundness error. Obtaining a constant-round protocol requires a strong parallel repetition theorem for classical verification of quantum computation, which we show following the 'nearly orthogonal projector' proof strategy (Alagic et al., TCC 2020).",Secure Quantum Computation with Classical Communication,,Bartusek and  J,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:22:20,

Sels et al. identify a promising application for such a quantum-classic hybrid approach, namely inferring molecular structure from NMR spectra, by employing a range of machine learning tools in combination with a quantum simulator. Recent technological advances may lead to the development of small-scale quantum computers that are capable of solving problems that cannot be tackled with classical computers. A limited number of algorithms have been proposed and their relevance to real-world problems is a subject of active investigation. Analysis of many-body quantum systems is particularly challenging for classical computers due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles. Hence, solving the problems relevant to chemistry and condensed-matter physics is expected to be the first successful application of quantum computers. In this Article, we propose another class of problems from the quantum realm that can be solved efficiently on quantum computers: model inference for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is important for biological and medical research. Our results are based on three interconnected studies. First, we use methods from classical machine learning to analyse a dataset of NMR spectra of small molecules. We perform stochastic neighbourhood embedding and identify clusters of spectra, and demonstrate that these clusters are correlated with the covalent structure of the molecules.

The spin manipulation executes quantum computation ranging over all Hilbert space, which is achieved by sets of quantum gate operations, called universal gates. The bus electron spin quantum bits (qubits) interact extensively with other electron spins and relatively localized nuclear spins as client qubits. Since the electron spins play the central role in MSQCs, MSQCs can simply be regarded as ESR-QCs. Generally compared with NMR-QC, ESR-QCs have advantages in fast gate operations, global control in client qubits, and initialization process. On the other hand, apparent disadvantages are fast decoherence and technical difficulties in current spin manipulation technology. In this chapter, we introduce the implementation of an adiabatic quantum computation from the theoretical point of view. The main issue is quantum operations in realistic Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs) based on molecular spin systems, suggesting that the established experimental schemes and protocols render MSQCs realistic. For this purpose, an algorithm is selected for an adiabatic factorization problem of 21, as we compare with the comparable algorithm of NMR experiments with three nuclear qubits. Toward adiabatic quantum computation on MSQCs, two molecular spin systems are selected: One is a molecular spin composed of three exchange/dipole-coupled electrons as electron-only spin qubits and the other an electron-bus qubit with two client nuclear spin qubits. Their electronic spin structures are well characterized particularly in terms of quantum mechanical behavior as interpreted by their spin Hamiltonians. The implementation of AQC has been achieved by establishing ESR/MR pulse sequences applied to the spin Hamiltonians in a fully controlled manner of spin manipulation. The conquered pulse sequences have been compared with the NMR-QC experiments and standard QCs. A significant result is that MSQCs can perform adiabatic quantum computations efficiently as same as standard QCs, and the computations can be performed in ESR timescale even if the client nuclear spin qubits participate in the computation processes.",Adiabatic Quantum Computing on Molecular Spin Quantum Computers,,Yamamoto and  S; Nakazawa and  S; Sugisaki and  K; Sato and  K; Toyota and  K; Shiomi and  D; Takeji and  T,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 18:18:15,

However, these technologies are not yet mature and create a significant vendor lock-in problem. Therefore, new tools are needed that facilitate access to this technology and that allow developers to increase the abstraction level at which they work. Given that the integration of quantum software should not be very different from that of classical services, we can take advantage of the knowledge acquired and use current techniques of service-oriented computing.

This means that developers must assume a different attitude towards programming, and aim at error-free software before its execution. This is commonly facilitated using simulators, which are commonplace for both HPC and QC. However the fashion developers advance from one tool to another is ad-hoc, with no established software engineering guidelines, and the final step from simulators to HPC/QC is still a leap of faith, comparable to releasing software.

To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users' selection in a 'win-lose' manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a 'win-win' manner.

We show that, in contrast to classical computing, it is in general not necessary to compare the complete representation of the respective computations. Even small errors frequently affect the entire representation and, thus, can be detected within a couple of simulations. The resulting equivalence checking flow substantially improves upon the state of the art by drastically accelerating the detection of errors or providing a highly probable estimate of the operations' equivalence.",The Power of Simulation for Equivalence Checking in Quantum Computing,LIT Secure and Correct Systems Lab - State of Upper Austria,Burgholzer and  L; Wille and  R,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:08:20,

Thus, researchers in industry and academia have focused on designing in-fridge classical controllers in order to mitigate these challenges. Due to the maturity of CMOS logic, many industrial efforts (Microsoft, Intel) have focused on Cryo-CMOS as a near-term solution to design in-fridge classical controllers. Meanwhile, Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) is an alternative, less mature classical logic family proposed for large-scale in-fridge controllers. SFQ logic has the potential to maximize scalability thanks to its ultra-high speed and very low power consumption. However, architecture design for SFQ logic poses challenges due to its unconventional pulse-driven nature and lack of dense memory and logic. Thus, research at the architecture level is essential to guide architects to design SFQ-based classical controllers for large-scale quantum machines. In this paper, we present DigiQ, the first system-level design of a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)-friendly SFQ-based classical controller. We perform a design space exploration of SFQ-based controllers and co-design the quantum gate decompositions and SFQ-based implementation of those decompositions to find an optimal SFQ-friendly design point that trades area and power for latency and control while ensuring good quantum algorithmic performance. Our co-design results in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) controller architecture, which has high scalability, but imposes new challenges on the calibration of control pulses. We present software-level solutions to address these challenges, which if unaddressed would degrade quantum circuit fidelity given the imperfections of qubit hardware. To validate and characterize DigiQ, we first implement it using hardware description languages and synthesize it using state-of-the-art/validated SFQ synthesis tools. Our synthesis results show that DigiQ can operate within the tight power and area budget of dilution refrigerators at >42,000-qubit scales. Second, we confirm the effectiveness of DigiQ in running quantum algorithms by modeling the execution time and fidelity of a variety of NISQ applications.

In this paper, we consider the time-space complexity and prove strictly that quantum computing has advantages compared to their classical counterparts.

Our simulator runs a fault path counter on encoded circuit blocks to determine the probability that two or more errors remain on the encoded qubits after each block is executed, and it combines errors from all the encoded blocks to estimate performance metrics such as the logical qubit failure probability, the overall circuit failure probability, the number of qubits used, and the time required to run the overall circuit.

Our main result is that for certain fundamental network problems such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and shortest paths, quantum communication does not help in substantially speeding up distributed algorithms for these problems compared to the classical setting. In order to obtain this result, we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al. [SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial lower bounds for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact and approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are new even in the classical setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification, answering an open problem of Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio, matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the Server model and Quantum Simulation Theorem which together provide a connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The Server model is the standard twoparty communication complexity model augmented with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is carried over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this hardness further to quantum distributed computing. Our techniques, except the proof of the hardness in the Server model, require very little knowledge in quantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving bounds on quantum distributed algorithms.

Adiabatic evolution of quantum systems have been studied as a potential means that physically realizes such quantum computation. Up to now, all the research on adiabatic quantum systems has dealt with polynomial time-bounded computation and little attention has been paid to, for example, adiabatic quantum systems consuming only constant memory space. Such quantum systems can be modeled in a form similar to quantum finite automata. This exposition dares to ask a bold question of how to make adiabatic quantum computation fit into the rapidly progressing framework of quantum automata theory. As our answer to this eminent but profound question, we first lay out a basic framework of adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems (AEQSs) with limited computational resources and then establish their close connection to quantum finite automata.

Since any currently available implementations suffer from noise and imperfections, achieving concrete speedups for meaningful problem sizes remains a major challenge. Yet, imperfections and noise may remain present in quantum computing for a long while. Such limitations play no role in classical software computing, and software engineers are typically not well accustomed to considering such imperfections, albeit they substantially influence core properties of software and systems. In this paper, we show how to model imperfections with an approach tailored to (quantum) software engineers. We intuitively illustrate, using numerical simulations, how imperfections influence core properties of quantum algorithms on NISQ systems, and show possible options for tailoring future NISQ machines to improve system performance in a co-design approach. Our results are obtained from a software framework that we provide in form of an easy-to-use reproduction package.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75% reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the tool used in a leading QAOA study.",Optimal Layout Synthesis for Quantum Computing,NEC under the Center for Domain-Specific Computing Industrial Partnership Program; Google Quantum team,Tan and  BC; Cong and  JS,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 13:46:26,

As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of approximate to 40%. To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of approximate to 30%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of approximate to 45%.",Robust and Secure Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computation on Untrusted Cloud-Based Quantum Hardware,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Penn State ICDS; Huck Institute of the Life Sciences,Upadhyay and  S; Ghosh and  S,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 1:49:07,

However, the main results on quantum walk search are scattered over different, incomparable frameworks, such as the hitting time framework, the MNRS framework, and the electric network framework. As a consequence, a number of pieces are currently missing. For example, recent work by Ambainis et al. (STOC'20) shows how quantum walks starting from the stationary distribution can always find elements quadratically faster. In contrast, the electric network framework allows quantum walks to start from an arbitrary initial state, but it only detects marked elements. We present a new quantum walk search framework that unifies and strengthens these frameworks, leading to a number of new results. For example, the new framework effectively finds marked elements in the electric network setting. The new framework also allows to interpolate between the hitting time framework, minimizing the number of walk steps, and the MNRS framework, minimizing the number of times elements are checked for being marked. This allows for a more natural tradeoff between resources. In addition to quantum walks and phase estimation, our new algorithm makes use of quantum fast-forwarding, similar to the recent results by Ambainis et al. This perspective also enables us to derive more general complexity bounds on the quantum walk algorithms, e.g., based on Monte Carlo type bounds of the corresponding classical walk. As a final result, we show how in certain cases we can avoid the use of phase estimation and quantum fast-forwarding, answering an open question of Ambainis et al.",A Unified Framework of Quantum Walk Search,CWI-Inria International Lab; Dutch Research Council (NWO) through QuantERA ERA-NET Cofund project,Apers and  S; Gily?n and  A; Jeffery and  S,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:10:12,

Unlike software-based quantum computation simulators, which run on standard general-purpose computers and suffer from reduced performance, this hardware design, which is based on classical concepts of bits, registers and memories, aims to leverage pure parallelism and pipelined execution for efficient quantum computations via emulation. The architecture includes several key components: memories, computation unit, measurement unit and control unit. The quantum state memory stores the individual and group states of qubits. This memory is crucial for maintaining the quantum information required for quantum operations. Basic operators are stored in dedicated operator memory. Additionally, a scratch memory allows for larger operators to be dynamically built at runtime. The computation unit is responsible for performing complex number multiplications, which form the basis of tensor and matrix products necessary for executing quantum operations. A measurement unit enables quantum state sampling, which is an essential aspect of quantum computation. Furthermore, a control unit is incorporated to ensure the correct operation of the quantum processor's data path. It utilizes a microprogram to manage and coordinate the functional units. All the functional units communicate with each other through dedicated and shared data buses, depending on the frequency of information exchange. This enables efficient data transfer and coordination among the components. The proposed hardware design has been simulated and proved to be effective in executing quantum operations.

ANN is used for classifying software modules into fault-proneness or non fault-proneness categories, and QPSO is applied for reducing dimensionality.

This paper presents quantum computing (QC) based deep learning methods for fault diagnosis that are capable of overcoming the computational challenges faced by conventional techniques performed on classical computers. The shortcomings of such classical data-driven techniques are addressed by the proposed QC-based fault diagnosis model. A quantum computing assisted generative training process followed by supervised discriminative training is used to train this model. The applicability of proposed model and methods is demonstrated by applying them to process monitoring of Tennessee Eastman (TE) process.

We develop and implement a hybrid statistical physics - quantum mechanical approach to compute the Al-27 NMR shielding tensor and the corresponding isotropic shielding. The complex hybrid approach has been implemented to account explicitly for the thermal motions of all ionic species along with the solvent (water) molecules under realistic conditions encountered during experimental measurements. In the developed approach, first, Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation (NPT ensemble) of water solution containing Al3+, 4OH- ions, and 3000 water molecules in a cubic box, employing periodic boundary conditions is carried out. Subsequently, the MC 'trajectories' are analyzed by time-series analytic methods (e.g. implementing the energy autocorrelation functions) so that out of a very large overall number of MC configurations that have been generated, only 100 representative ones are picked up, with negligible mutual statistical interdependence. NMR shielding tensors are subsequently computed for such chosen configurations at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df, 3pd) level of theory, using various approaches to include the environment of the 'central' Al ion. In the simplest approach, all environment (within sufficiently large distance) is considered as being built up by point charges (accounted for explicitly or within the ASEC formalism). Further, the first solvation shell (consisting of 4 hydroxide ions) together with the central aluminum ions are described by a wavefunction, while the remaining solvent molecules are treated as point charges or the 'bulk' solvent is considered to be a polarizable continuum.

This is the first succinct argument for quantum computation in the plain model; prior work (Chia-Chung-Yamakawa, TCC '20) requires both a long common reference string and non-black-box use of a hash function modeled as a random oracle. At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically verifiable quantum computation (Mahadev, FOCS '18). We give a self-contained, modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the verifier's first message (which consists of many public keys) is compressed. Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on indistinguishability obfuscation.

However, testing quantum computations for faults is currently impractical because of the existence of noise and errors associated with the output. Executing in a quantum system a circuit with only a few valid output states can generate a significant number of implausible states that have zero probability in an ideal computation. Among other sources of noise, readout errors come from the difficulty of discriminating a measurement between 0 and 1 for the different qubits. These issues are affected by readout drift, requiring regular recalibration of the process. In this paper, we provide a novel technique for postcomputation analysis of the output probability distributions that permits better discrimination of kerneled data, delaying the need for recalibration. We achieve this by altering the linear discrimination of the final output states by way of a dynamic state selection process that combines Gaussian mixture models with a probability threshold. As an initial assessment of the technique we examine its effect on three to five qubits GHZ states.

The embedding was used to sample missing visible units and labels of incomplete test images. The previously introduced RBM embedding that combined qubits into individual RBM units in order to increase the connectivity between units was used. In comparison to the 1000 qubit machine investigated earlier, the same embedding approach applied to the 2000 qubit D-Wave enabled a connectivity between RBM units sufficient for RBM training on a classical computer with a satisfactory classification error. After a varied number of CD training iterations, the visible units corresponding to a particular incomplete test image were fixed in the D-Wave embedding. The resulting state returned by the D- Wave represents the most energetically favorable combination of the remaining qubits for the given fixed incomplete input image. The classification errors compared favorably to those obtained by the classical MCMC sampling. Main factors influencing the quality of the embedding were investigated. Regardless of the computational cost incentives for using the D-Wave for this operation, the reconstruction and classification errors determined in this way can be used at least as a verification of the validity and quality of the particular embedding of the given RBM architecture.

The computational approach is robust and inherently sequential. First, the studied physico-chemical system is modeled by a statistical physics approach, either Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD). Though in the first phase it is often sufficient to carry out a classical MC or MD simulation, in particular cases, when it is necessary, one can also perform a quantum molecular dynamics simulation (e.g. ADMP, BOMD or CPMD). Even the classical MC/MD simulations carried out in the first phase can be based on interaction potentials which have been derived by quantum chemical calculations. Sequentially to the first phase of the computation, which actually generates either a MD trajectory or an appropriate sample of the system's configurational space, the generated trajectories are analyzed employing time-series analytic methods. On the basis of such analysis, a representative number of configurations representing the state of the physicochemical system at finite temperature is chosen, which are further analyzed by a quantum mechanical approach. These, appropriately chosen configurations for the system of interest, are further modeled by exact quantum mechanical (QM) approach. The particular approach that needs to be implemented depends on the quantity that needs to be computed. For example, in the case of X-H stretching vibrations, the anharmonic X-H vibrational frequency is computed in a quantum mechanical manner with respect to both electronic and nuclear subsystem. In this case, first a 1D cut through the vibrational potential energy surface is computed at series of suitably generated points, and subsequently, the vibrational Schrodinger equation is solved either by diagonalization approach or using a variant of the discrete variable representation (DVR) methodology. As the statistical mechanics simulations are often done implementing periodic boundary condition, the exact QM calculations in the final simulation phase are often done implementing some sort of embedding of the relevant part of the system. All these aspects of our developed methodology are illustrated through a particular example - the fluoroform solvated in liquid Kr and the noncovalently bonded complexes which are formed between fluoroform and dimethylether in liquid Kr. A vast variety of condensed phase systems can be treated by the developed approach. Achieving good parallel efficiency for calculations of such type is far from a trivial task without the use of high-performance low-latency MPI interconnect (such as, e.g. a supercomputer or HPC cluster).",Development of a Hybrid Statistical Physics - Quantum Mechanical Methodology for Computer Simulations of Condensed Phases and Its Implementation on High-Performance Computing Systems,,Pejov and  L; Sahpaski and  D; Kohls and  E; Mishev and  A,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 15:01:41,

Among the different available post-quantum public-key algorithms, Supersingular Isogeny Key-Encapsulation (SIKE) has posed a unique design challenge due to its resource intensive arithmetic but is characterized by small key sizes. Existing implementations of SIKE either focus on dedicated accelerators on FPGA platforms or on assembly optimized software implementations on ARM. A full FPGA implementation, though offering low latency and high performance, suffers from the disadvantage of having a large area footprint and a low flexibility. On the other hand, a pure software implementation has lower performance compared to FPGA implementations. In this paper, we propose hardware/software co-design methodologies for SIKE and integrate a redundant number based finite field accelerator into two microcontroller platforms based on ARM and RISC-V. The result shows that our implementation on ARM Cortex-A9 enhanced with a field accelerator offers significant speedup in terms of clock cycles when compared to standalone software implementations on ARM32 and ARM64.

In particular, our classical SVT framework recovers and often improves the dequantization results on recommendation systems, principal component analysis, supervised clustering, support vector machines, low-rank regression, and semidefinite program solving. We also give additional dequantization results on low-rank Hamiltonian simulation and discriminant analysis.

In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing largescale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits.

Ultimately, each party receives only its own correct output. In this paper, a post-quantum secure two-party computation protocol is proposed that can be used to effectively block malicious parties. The protocol solves the problems of traditional protocols based on garbled circuits, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks, high communication costs and low computational efficiency. The input garbled keys of the circuit constructor is structured as a Learning with Error (LWE) equation, enabling the circuit constructor to employ a zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates the uniformity of inputs across all circuits.In the key transfer phase, an LWE-based batch single-choice cut-and-choose oblivious transfer is proposed to avoid selective failure attacks. In addition, the protocol employs a penalty mechanism to detect if the circuit constructor has generated an incorrect circuit. We have compared the communication overhead of this protocol with three other secure two-party computation protocols based on Cut-and-Choose technology. The analytical results show that this protocol has the best error probability and is resilient to quantum attacks under the malicious adversary model. In addition, with appropriate parameters, the protocol is able to reduce its communication bandwidth by an average of 40.41%.",Post-quantum secure two-party computing protocols against malicious adversaries,"This work was supported by the Henan Province Key Ramp;D and Promotion Special Grant 212102210166, and the Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security Grant ICNS202006.; Henan Province Key Ramp;D and Promotion Special Grant; Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Information Communication Network and Security Grant",Huo and  YC; Zhao and  ZQ; Qin and  PK; Wang and  SJ; Zheng and  CF,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 15:04:50,

The scarcity of information on He@hydrates makes such complexes challenging targets, while their computational study entails an interesting and arduous task. Some of them have been synthesized in the laboratory, which motivates further investigations on their stability. Hence, the main focus is to examine the performance and accuracy of different wave function-based electronic structure methods, such as MP2, CCSD(T), their explicitly correlated (F12) and domain-based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) analogs, as well as modern and conventional density functional theory (DFT) approaches, and analytical model potentials available.

In this empirical study, we monitor the reliability of IBM's public-access QCs network on a daily basis. Each of these state-of-the-art machines has a totally different qubit association, and this entails that for a given (same) input program, they may output a different set of probabilities for the assembly of results (including both the right and the wrong ones). Although we focus on the computing structure provided by the 'Big Blue' company, our survey can be easily transferred to other currently available quantum mainframes. In more detail, we probe these quantum processors with an ad hoc designed computationally demanding quaternary search algorithm. As stated, this quantum program is executed every 24 hours (for nearly 100 days) and its goal is to put to the limit the operational capacity of this novel and genuine type of equipment. Next, we perform a comparative analysis of the obtained results according to the singularities of each computer and over the total number of executions. In addition, we subsequently apply (for 50 days) an improvement filtering to perform noise mitigation on the results obtained proposed by IBM. The Yorktown 5-qubit computer reaches noise filtering of up to 33% in one day, that is, a 90% confidence level is reached in the expected results. From our continuous and long-term tests, we derive that room still exists regarding the improvement of quantum calculators in order to guarantee enough confidence in the returned outcomes.",Reliability of IBM's Public Quantum Computers,Universidad Internacional de la Rioja (UNIR) through the Research Institute for Innovation & Technology in Education (UNIR iTED),P?rez-Ant?n and  R; Corbi and  A; S?nchez and  JIL; Burgos and  D,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 13:47:22,

Since the number of qubits and quantum system is getting bigger, we need a scalable and universal quantum computing platform based on LOQC. In this work, we propose a software framework which can support a universal programming with flexibility of LOQC hardware configuration.

39874721,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,Quantum Compilers; Correlated Errors; NISQ,"Near-term quantum computers do not have the ability to perform error correction. Such Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can produce incorrect output as the computation is subjected to errors. The applications on a NISQ machine try to infer the correct output by running the same program thousands of times and logging the output. If the error rates are low and the errors are not correlated, then the correct answer can be inferred as the one appearing with the highest frequency. Unfortunately, quantum computers are subjected to correlated errors, which can cause an incorrect answer to appear more frequently than the correct answer. We observe that recent work on qubit mapping (including the recent work on variation-aware mapping) tries to obtain the best possible qubit allocation and uses it for all the trials. This approach significantly increases the vulnerability to correlated errors - if the mapping becomes susceptible to a particular form of error, then all the trials will get subjected to the same error, which can cause the same wrong answer to appear as the output for a significant fraction of the trials. To mitigate the vulnerability to such correlated errors, this paper leverages the concept of diversity and proposes an Ensemble of Diverse Mappings (EDM). EDM uses diversity in qubit allocation to run copies of an input program with a diverse set of mappings, thus steering the trials towards making different mistakes. By combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, EDM amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect answers. Our experiments with ibmq-melbourne (14-qubit) machine shows that EDM improves the inference quality by 2.3x compared to the current state-of-the-art mapping algorithms.",Ensemble of Diverse Mappings: Improving Reliability of Quantum Computers by Orchestrating Dissimilar Mistakes,,Tannu and  SS; Qureshi and  M,,o,,-1,2024-02-20 15:12:40,

By approximating fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume (qubits x gates, or 'Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)') of near-term machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program [58]. Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical quantum bit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of typical, contemporary quantum system designs. Under a pure dephasing error model, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term machines.

Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle. Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism. We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories.

Thus, this work's contribution stands in a first step towards answering those questions as an attempt to identify key findings in the existing literature that should be considered or adapted in order to build hybrid or fully-quantum algorithms that can be used in quantum machines.

To support this inference we present a scheme of a 'gedanken experiment' in combination with known statistical data from a real experiment, the forbidden toy paradigm. Our findings show that the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance is a source of probabilistic non-classicality directly violating Bayes formula for conditional probability and so the law of total probability.

Hydrogen energy has the advantage of low carbon dioxide emission and the ability to generate a lot of energy per weight. However, gaseous hydrogen has a low hydrogen storage density per unit volume, so a liquefaction process is required. Liquid hydrogen has a lower pressure than hydrogen in gaseous state, so the risk of explosion is low and transportation cost is reduced because it is easy to transport in large quantities. Therefore, the hydrogen liquefaction process is important and can improve energy efficiency. Specific Energy Consumption (SEC), commonly used as a performance indicator in the hydrogen liquefaction process, is the sum of energy consumed in the entire process to liquefy 1 kg of hydrogen. However, since the uncertainty of the attribute values lowers the accuracy of prediction, in order to overcome this issue, this study proposes a framework for predicting the SEC value according to the attribute value using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on quantum mechanics.

These IGs are composed of a silicate-based core covered by several layers of amorphous water ice, known as a grain mantle. Molecules from the ISM gas-phase can be adsorbed at the grain surfaces, diffuse and react to give iCOMs and ultimately desorbed back to the gas phase. Thus, the study of the Binding Energy (BE) of these molecules at the water ice grain surface is important to understand the molecular composition of the ISM and its evolution in time. In this paper, we propose to use a recently developed semiempirical quantum approach, named GFN-xTB, and more precisely the GFN2 method, to compute the BE of several molecular species at the crystalline water ice slab model. This method is very cheap in term of computing power and time and was already showed in a previous work to be very accurate with small water clusters. To support our proposition, we decided to use, as a benchmark, the recent work published by some of us in which a crystalline model of proton-ordered water ice (P-ice) was adopted to predict the BEs of 21 molecules relevant in the ISM. The relatively good results obtained confirm GFN2 as the method of choice to model adsorption processes occurring at the icy grains in the ISM.

A primary challenge is classical-to-quantum (C2Q) data encoding, which requires specific circuits for quantum state initialization, particularly for I/O intensive applications. The required state initialization circuits are often complex, and violate decoherence constraints. Another critical challenge for quantum computers is quantum state readout or quantum-to-classical (Q2C) data decoding. The general approach for Q2C involves repeated sampling of the quantum circuit, which often incurs significant overhead in the overall execution time. In this paper, we propose time-efficient methods for C2Q data encoding and Q2C data decoding for quantum algorithms. Decoherence optimized circuits for C2Q data encoding are presented along with analysis of their circuit depths. For Q2C, a novel approach based on more efficient sampling of the output state using the Quantum Wavelet Transform is proposed. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated on a state-of-the-art quantum computing device from IBM Quantum using realistic multi-spectral data. Experimental results are consistent with our theoretical expectations and confirm the efficiency of our proposed methods compared to existing techniques.

We find that TILT can substantially reduce communication as compared with comparable-sized Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures. We also develop two important scheduling heuristics for TILT. The first heuristic reduces the number of swap operations by matching data traveling in opposite directions into an 'opposing swap.', and also avoids the maximum swap distance across the width of the head, as maximum swap distances make scheduling multiple swaps in one head position difficult. The second heuristic minimizes ion chain motion by scheduling the tape to the position with the maximal executable operations for every movement. We provide application performance results from our simulation, which suggest that TILT can outperform QCCD in a range of NISQ applications in terms of success rate (up to 4.35x and 1.95x on average).

Existing quantum programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of 1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient, high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and 2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting quantum architectures.

Nevertheless, in the mobile edge computing system, if no popular content is cached in the edge server, users will repeatedly send requests to a remote cloud data center when requesting content, which will cause delay and backhaul link load.

QC offers a powerful stage for solving complex and compound problems like searching and number factoring. A critical task in utilizing quantum physics in many application fields is circuit design using reversible quantum gates. Unitary decomposition is a popular scheme for mapping quantum algorithms to any set of elementary quantum operations. Using decomposition techniques enables transformation of unitary matrices into fundamental quantum gates, which is critical for running algorithms on prevailing quantum computers.

We introduce the weak and strong satisfiability problem for quantum logic propositional formulae. It turns out that in dimension two, both are also NP-complete. For higher-dimensional spaces R-d and C-d with d >= 3 fixed, on the other hand, we show both problems to be complete for the nondeterministic Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) model of real computation. This provides a unified view on both Turing and real BSS complexity theory, and extends the (still relatively scarce) list of problems established NPR-complete with one, perhaps, closest in spirit to the classical Cook-Levin Theorem. More precisely, strong satisfiability of boolean AND boolean OR boolean AND-terms is complete, while that of boolean AND boolean OR-terms (i.e., those in conjunctive form) can be decided in polynomial time in dimensions d >= 2. The decidability of the infinite-dimensional case being still open, we proceed to investigate the case of indefinite finite dimensions.

Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) model of computing. As NISQ machines exhibit high error-rates, only programs that require a few qubits can be executed reliably. Therefore, NISQ machines tend to underutilize its resources. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput and utilization of NISQ machines by using multi-programming and enabling the NISQ machine to concurrently execute multiple workloads. Multi-programming a NISQ machine is non-trivial. This is because, a multi-programmed NISQ machine can have an adverse impact on the reliability of the individual workloads. To enable multi-programming in a robust manner, we propose three solutions. First, we develop methods to partition the qubits into multiple reliable regions using error information from machine calibration so that each program can have a fair allocation of reliable qubits. Second, we observe that when two programs are of unequal lengths, measurement operations can impact the reliability of the co-running program. To reduce this interference, we propose a Delayed Instruction Scheduling (DIS) policy that delays the start of the shorter program so that all the measurement operations can be performed at the end. Third, we develop an Adaptive Multi-Programming (AMP) design that monitors the reliability at runtime and reverts to single program mode if the reliability impact of multi-programming is greater than a predefined threshold.

This is in contrast to previous protocols, whose overhead in terms of resources employed, while polynomial, is far beyond what is feasible in practice. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit or its input. The second protocol is not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction. Our main technical innovation is an efficient rigidity theorem which allows a verifier to test that two entangled provers perform measurements specified by an arbitrary m-qubit tensor product of single-qubit Clifford observables on their respective halves of m shared EPR pairs, with a robustness that is independent of m.

Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler.

When combined with thermal system parameters such as cooling efficiency and cryostat heat transfer, the total energy use can be determined using a first-principles energy model. These models show that cooling of quantum computers differs in two fundamental ways from conventional data centers: (1) the energy required for cooling is much greater than the energy required for computation, and (2) the cooling loads are sensitive to the computational architecture. The temperature requirements for different qubit types can change energy requirements by orders of magnitude.

In order to overcome the problem of limited interconnectivity in the D-Wave architecture, the proposed RBM embedding combines multiple qubits to represent a particular RBM unit. The results for the lowest-energy (the ground state) and some of the higher-energy states found by the D-Wave 2X were compared with those of the classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. In many cases, the D-Wave machine successfully found the same RBM lowest-energy state as that found by SA. In some examples, the D-Wave machine returned a state corresponding to one of the higher-energy local minima found by SA. The inherently nonperfect embedding of the RBM into the Chimera lattice explored in this work (i.e., multiple qubits combined into a single RBM unit were found not to be guaranteed to be all aligned) and the existence of small, persistent biases in the D-Wave hardware may cause a discrepancy between the D-Wave and the SA results. In some of the investigated cases, introduction of a small bias field into the energy function or optimization of the chain-strength parameter in the D-Wave embedding successfully addressed difficulties of the particular RBM embedding.

The security definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based, and not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable, computational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new definitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational: a scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into an ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to block messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By modifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one gets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations are composable, resulting in composable security. Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the asymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite reduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from the ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite instance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to make security claims about concrete implementations. We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the literature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the relations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones.

In this paper, a multi-client universal circuit-based full-blind quantum computation (FBQC) model is proposed. In order to meet the requirements of multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data, all clients with limited quantum ability outsource the key generation to a trusted key center and upload their encrypted data to the data center. Considering the feasibility of physical implementation, all quantum gates in the circuit are replaced with the combination of pi/8 rotation operator set {R-z(pi/4), Ry(pi/4), CRz(pi/4), CRy(pi/4), CCRz(pi/4), CCRy(pi/4)}. In addition, the data center is only allowed to perform one pi/8 rotation operator each time, but does not know the structure of the circuit (i.e., quantum computation), so it can guarantee the blindness of computation. Then, through combining this multi-client FBQC model and Grover searching algorithm, we continue to propose a quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud data. It solves the problem of multi-client access mode under searchable encryption in the cloud environment, and has the ability to resist against some quantum attacks. To better demonstrate our scheme, an example of our scheme to search on encrypted 2-qubit state is given in detail. Furthermore, the security of our scheme is analysed from two aspects: external attacks and internal attacks, and the result indicates that it can resist against such kinds of attacks and also guarantee the blindness of data and computation.",Quantum Searchable Encryption for Cloud Data Based on Full-Blind Quantum Computation,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); High-quality and Cutting-edge Disciplines Construction Project for Universities in Beijing (Internet Information, Communication University of China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)",Liu and  WJ; Xu and  YS; Liu and  W; Wang and  HB; Lei and  ZB,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 22:31:51,

We argue that in many situations this semiclassical theory will be a close approximation to quantum field theory. In a more speculative argument, we discuss the possibility that the apparent quantization of the electromagnetic field could be a result of (1) quantization of interactions of the electromagnetic field with matter and (2) wave packets, regions within the electromagnetic field that are approximate photons.

In these logics well-formed formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information: possible pure states of quantum systems that can store the information in question. At the same time, the logical connectives are interpreted as quantum logical gates: unitary operators that process quantum information in a reversible way, giving rise to quantum circuits. Quantum computational logics have been mainly studied as sentential logics(whose alphabet consists of atomic sentences and of logical connectives). In this article we propose a semantic characterization for a first-order epistemic quantum computational logic, whose language can express sentences like 'Alice knows that everybody knows that she is pretty'. One can prove that (unlike the case of logical connectives) both quantifiers and epistemic operators cannot be generally represented as (reversible) quantum logical gates. The 'act of knowing' and the use of universal (or existential) assertions seem to involve some irreversible 'theoretic jumps', which are similar to quantum measurements. Since all epistemic agents are characterized by specific epistemic domains(which contain all pieces of information accessible to them), the unrealistic phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided: knowing a given sentence does not imply knowing all its logical consequences.

Recently, a new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the server, the client pays a reward to the server depending on the server's messages and the client's random bits. The rational server sends messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational sumcheck protocol. An advantage of our protocols is that they are gate-set independent: the construction of the previous rational protocols depends on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any local gate set (each of whose elementary gates can be specified with a polynomial number of bits). Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward function satisfies natural requirements (the reward is non-negative, upper-bounded by a constant, and its maximum expected value is lower-bounded by a constant). We also discuss the reward gap. Simply speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept an incorrect answer. The reward gap should therefore be large enough to incentivize the server to behave optimally. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between rational and ordinary delegated quantum computing protocols. This equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, these devices are restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges. For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here, we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision. When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through modularity.

To overcome these challenges, new scheduling approaches on the HPC side and new programming approaches on the QC side are required.",Accelerating HPC With Quantum Computing: It Is a Software Challenge Too,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action; Bavarian StateMinistry of Science and the Arts as part of Munich Quantum Valley (MQV),Schulz and  M; Ruefenacht and  M; Kranzlm?ller and  D; Schulz and  LB,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 17:33:44,

39874864,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,,"Over the past few years, several quantum software stacks (QSS) have been developed in response to rapid hardware advances in quantum computing. A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity. This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDIFF with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy. We evaluate QDIFF with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDIFF on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDIFF's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",QDiff: Differential Testing of Quantum Software Stacks,National Science Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research); Intel CAPA grant,Wang and  JY; Zhang and  Q; Xu and  GH; Kim and  M,,o,,1,2024-02-23 20:49:47,

This is so because light viewed in such a manner can be thought of as the basis for a universal complex adaptive system. In such a light-based system, quantization is the mechanism that progressively materializes subtle information imagined existing in antecedent layers of light. Arbitrated dynamics between layers of light set up a mechanism of feedback-loops and constitute a process of persistent quantum-level computation, whose output is suggested to be genetic-type information. Such arbitrated dynamics are the result of an initiating urge at the material level, and when strong and cohesive enough, result in a state of quantum certainty. Quantum certainty precipitates fourfold space-time-energy-gravity quantization. While being the script which all genetic-type change is written in, it is also suggested that this script alters the expansion-contraction dynamics of the cosmos.",The Role of a Light-Based Quantum Computational Model in the Creation of an Oscillating Universe,,Malik and  P,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:14:00,

The client's goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical - it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter kappa, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of kappa, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of kappa. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.",Succinct Blind Quantum Computation using a Random Oracle,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),Zhang and  JY,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:15:31,

In terms of the time complexity of server-side quantum computations (which typically dominate the total time complexity of both the client and the server), the fastest singleserver CVQC protocol so far has complexity O(poly(kappa)|C|(3)) where |C| is the size of the circuit to be verified and kappa is the security parameter, given by Mahadev [4]. This leads to a similar cubic time blowup in many existing protocols including multiparty quantum computation, zero knowledge and obfuscation [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Considering the preciousness of quantum computation resources, this cubic complexity barrier could be a big obstacle for theoretical and practical development of protocols for these problems. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity O(poly(kappa)|C|) (in terms of the total time complexity of both the client and the server), which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [11] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [12], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in {|+theta > = 1/root 2 (| 0 > + e(i theta pi/4) |1 >) : theta is an element of{0, 1 center dot center dot center dot 7}}, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of L independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side simulator), and runs in only O(poly(kappa)L) time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [13], [14], [15], [16].",Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time,,Zhang and  JY,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 20:48:40,

Several approaches exist to further reduce the size of decision diagrams, i.e., their number of nodes. Reordering is one such approach to shrink decision diagrams by changing the order of variables in the representation. In the conventional world, this approach is established and its availability taken for granted. For quantum computing however, first approaches exist, but could not fully exploit a similar potential yet. In this paper, we investigate the differences between reordering decision diagrams in the conventional and the quantum world and, afterwards, unveil challenges that explain why reordering is much harder in the latter.

The key challenge is rooted on the 'semantic gap' between different low-level content features and high-level semantic information. Existing approaches generally utilize a combination of multimodal features in a somehow heuristic way. However, how to employ and combine multiple information from different sources effectively is still an important yet largely unsolved problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a Quantum-inspired Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (QMSA) framework. The framework consists of a Quantum-inspired Multimodal Representation (QMR) model (which aims to fill the 'semantic gap' and model the correlations between different modalities via density matrix), and a Multimodal decision Fusion strategy inspired by Quantum Interference (QJMF) in the double-slit experiment (in which the sentiment label is analogous to a photon, and the data modalities are analogous to slits).

Our attacks are not as efficient as polynomial-time attacks making quantum superposition queries, while our attacks use the realistic model and overwhelmingly improve the classical attacks. Our attacks convert a type of classical meet-in-the-middle attacks into quantum ones. The attack cost depends on the number of available qubits and the way to realize the quantum hardware. The tradeoffs between data complexity D and time complexity T against the problem of cardinality N are D-2 . T-2 = N and D .T-6 = N-3 in the best and worst case scenarios to the adversary respectively, while the classic attack requires D . T = N. This improvement is meaningful from an engineering aspect because several existing schemes claim beyond-birthday-bound security for T by limiting the maximum D to be below 2(n/2 )according to the classical tradeoff D . T = N. Those schemes are broken when quantum computations are available to the adversaries. The attack can be applied to many schemes such as a tweakable block-cipher construction TDR, a dedicated MAC scheme Chaskey, an on-line authenticated encryption scheme McOE-X, a hash function based MAC H-2 -MAC and a permutation based MAC keyed-sponge.

Gene selection problem has a large number of genes (relevant, redundant or noise), which needs an effective method to help us in detecting diseases and cancer. In this problem, computational complexity is reduced by selecting a small number of genes, but it is necessary to choose the relevant genes to keep a high level of accuracy. Therefore, in order to find the optimal gene subset, it is essential to devise an effective exploration approach that can investigate a large number of possible gene subsets. In addition, it is required to use a powerful evaluation method to evaluate the relevance of these gene subsets.

The purpose of QMFOA is to identify a small gene subset that can be used to classify samples with high accuracy. The QMFOA has a simple two-phase approach, the first phase is a pre-processing that uses to address the difficulty of high-dimensional data, which measure the redundancy and the relevance of the gene, in order to obtain the relevant gene set. The second phase is a hybridization among MFOA, quantum computing, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, etc., in order to solve the gene selection problem.

The combinatorial characterisation of determinism in this model, powered by measurements, and hence, fundamentally probabilistic, is the cornerstone of most of the breakthrough results in this field. The most general known sufficient condition for a deterministic MBQC to be driven is that the underlying graph of the computation has a particular kind of flow called Pauli flow. The necessity of the Pauli flow was an open question. We show that Pauli flow is not necessary, providing several counter examples. We prove however that Pauli flow is necessary for determinism in the real MBQC model, an interesting and useful fragment of MBQC. We explore the consequences of this result for real MBQC and its applications. Real MBQC and more generally real quantum computing is known to be universal for quantum computing. Real MBQC has been used for interactive proofs by McKague. The two-prover case corresponds to real-MBQC on bipartite graphs. While (complex) MBQC on bipartite graphs are universal, the universality of real MBQC on bipartite graphs was an open question. We show that real bipartite MBQC is not universal proving that all measurements of real bipartite MBQC can be parallelised leading to constant depth computations.

Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed routinely to analyze and process these big EO data, and one well-known ML technique is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). An SVM poses a quadratic programming problem, and quantum computers including quantum annealers (QA) as well as gate-based quantum computers promise to solve an SVM more efficiently than a conventional computer; training the SVM by employing a quantum computer/conventional computer represents a quantum SVM (qSVM)/classical SVM (cSVM) application. However, quantum computers cannot tackle many practical EO problems by using a qSVM due to their very low number of input qubits. Hence, we assembled a coreset ( 'core of a dataset ') of given EO data for training a weighted SVM on a small quantum computer, a D-Wave quantum annealer with around 5000 input quantum bits. The coreset is a small, representative weighted subset of an original dataset, and its performance can be analyzed by using the proposed weighted SVM on a small quantum computer in contrast to the original dataset. As practical data, we use synthetic data, Iris data, a Hyperspectral Image (HSI) of Indian Pine, and a Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image of San Francisco. We measured the closeness between an original dataset and its coreset by employing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence test, and, in addition, we trained a weighted SVM on our coreset data by using both a D-Wave quantum annealer (D-Wave QA) and a conventional computer. Our findings show that the coreset approximates the original dataset with very small KL divergence (smaller is better), and the weighted qSVM even outperforms the weighted cSVM on the coresets for a few instances of our experiments. As a side result (or a by-product result), we also present our KL divergence findings for demonstrating the closeness between our original data (i.e., our synthetic data, Iris data, hyperspectral image, and PolSAR image) and the assembled coreset.",Assembly of a Coreset of Earth Observation Images on a Small Quantum Computer,Juelich Supercomputing Centre through the Juelich UNified Infrastructure for Quantum computing (JUNIQ) on a D-Wave quantum annealer,Otgonbaatar and  S; Datcu and  M,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:05:57,

Simultaneously, there has been a proliferation of programming languages and program optimization tools for quantum computing. Existing quantum compilers use intermediate representations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such IRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it is non-trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the no-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce QSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables decades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum compilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The inputs and outputs of the operation are in one-to-one correspondence; qubits cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis pass that verifies no-cloning at compile-time. The quantum circuit is fully encoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing optimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and dead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM Quantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably to IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure.

In December 2017, 69 candidates were accepted by NIST to Round 1 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process. NTRUEncrypt is one of the most well-known PQC algorithms that has withstood cryptanalysis. The speed of NTRUEncrypt in software, especially on embedded software platforms, is limited by the long execution time of its primary operation, polynomial multiplication. In this paper, we investigate speeding up NTRUEncrypt using software/hardware codesign on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC). Polynomial multiplication is implemented in the Programmable Logic (PL) of Zynq using two approaches: traditional Register-Transfer Level (RTL) and High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The remaining operations of NTRUEncrypt are executed in software on the Processing System (PS) of Zynq, using the bare-metal mode. The speed-up of our software/hardware codesigns vs. purely software implementations is determined experimentally and analyzed in the paper. The results are reported for the RTL-based and HLS-based hardware accelerators, and compared to the best available software implementation, included in the NIST submission package. The speed-ups for encryption were 2.4 and 3.9, depending on the selected parameter set. For decryption, the corresponding speed-ups were 4.0 and 6.8.

To address the above challenges, we propose a commutativity-based compile-time instruction reordering approach. We first propose a complete set of generalized commutativity rules for main types of quantum gates, and then we design a two-level bidirectional reordering algorithm to reorder gates according to these rules for effective crosstalk mitigation.

The approach proposed is systematic, and based on existing software engineering standards like the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel and the Unified Modelling Language. It could therefore be applied in industry in a way that complies with the existing software evolution processes. The independence of this proposal with respect to quantum programming environments is also guaranteed, making its application feasible in the changing environment in today's quantum industry.

In order to accommodate this new class of codes, a proper environment has to be created, which enables the interplay between the quantum and classical hardware. For many of these hybrid processes the coherence time of the quantum computer arises as a natural time constraint, making it crucial to minimize the classical overhead. For ion-trap quantum computers however, this is a much less limiting factor than with superconducting technologies, since the relevant timescale is on the order of seconds instead of microseconds. In fact, we show that the operating time-scales of trapped-ion quantum computers are compatible with the execution speed of the Python programming language, enabling us to develop an interpreted scheme for real-time control of quantum computations. In particular, compilation of all instructions in advance is not necessary, unlike with superconducting qubits.

In this context, decision diagrams for quantum computation provide a major pillar as they allow to efficiently represent quantum states and quantum operations which, otherwise, have to be described in terms of exponentially large state vectors and unitary matrices. However, current decision diagrams for the quantum domain suffer from a tradeoff between accuracy and compactness, since: 1) small errors that are inevitably introduced by the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic can harm the compactness (i.e., the size of the decision diagram) significantly and 2) overcompensating these errors (to increase compactness) may lead to an information loss and introduces numerical instabilities. In this article, we describe and evaluate the effects of this tradeoff which clearly motivates the need for a solution that is perfectly accurate and compact at the same time.

Molecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum hardware is the target technology, where three non-ideality phenomena-common to other quantum technologies-are taken into account: decoherence, off-resonance qubit evolution, and undesired qubit-qubit residual interaction. A model for each non-ideality phenomenon is embedded into a MATLAB simulation infrastructure of noisy quantum computers. The accuracy of the models is tested on a benchmark of quantum circuits, in the expected operating ranges of quantum hardware. The corresponding outcomes are compared with those obtained via numeric integration of the Schrodinger equation and the Qiskit's QASMSimulator. The achieved results give evidence that this work is a step forward towards the definition of compact models able to provide fast results close to those obtained with the traditional physical simulation strategies, thus paving the way for their integration into a classical simulator of quantum computers.",Towards Compact Modeling of Noisy Quantum Computers: A Molecular-Spin-Qubit Case of Study,,Simoni and  M; Cirillo and  GA; Turvani and  G; Graziano and  M; Zamboni and  M,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 19:13:10,

The simulator uses the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm [3] to approximate the ground state energy of the input Hamiltonian, which is then compared to the classically-calculated exact value. This classical evaluation is possible because the systems studied are still within the grasp of classical computers. We also investigated ways to simplify the system before the pre-processing step. We found that in almost all cases these simplifications made our quantum calculations converge to better answers using simpler starting conditions.

One noise source is due to the direct coupling of a massive spin-based quantum system and classical gravitational fields, which will rotate the spin of a system. Accounting for this rotation, called the Wigner rotation, is extremely difficult, and its effect is cumulative for even the most basic operations in quantum computation. However, by embedding the computation into a slightly larger system, we can avoid the decoherence caused by gravity. Additionally, we show that asymptotically in this embedding, the ratio of usable qubits to the entire system is one.

While the classical computers only perform operations by manipulation of classical bits having two values 0 and 1, quantum bits can represent data in multiple states. This property of inheriting multiple states at a time is called superposition which gives quantum computers tremendous power over classical computers.

Intuitively and very roughly, the predicate-binding property guarantees that given any inconsistent predicate pair over a set of strings (i.e. no strings in this set can satisfy both predicates), if a (claimed) quantum commitment can be opened so that the revealed string satisfies one predicate with certainty, then the same commitment cannot be opened so that the revealed string satisfies the other predicate (except for a negligible probability). As an application, we plug a generic quantum perfectly(resp. statistically)-hiding computationally-binding bit commitment scheme in Blum's zero-knowledge protocol for the NP-complete language Hamiltonian Cycle. This will give rise to the first quantum perfect(resp. statistical) zero-knowledge argument system (with soundness error 1/2) for all NP languages based solely on quantum-secure one-way permutations(resp. functions). The quantum computational soundness of this system will follow immediately from the quantum computational predicatebinding property of commitments.",Quantum Computationally Predicate-Binding Commitments with Application in Quantum Zero-Knowledge Arguments for NP,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); PhD Start-up Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS; Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Information Security, IIE, CAS",Yan and  J,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:57:48,

The proposed inference engine was implemented using a quantum algorithm design scheme based on the oracle notion. This scheme allows the modeling of a fuzzy rule-based system as a Boolean function, the oracle, which is able to reconstruct the relationships between the antecedent and consequent parts of fuzzy rules, and can be efficiently computed on a quantum computer.

The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller. According to the simulation results, SDN over a QKD network using the SDQKRF model is more reliable and performs better in terms of the key generation ratio, key utilisation rate, recovery after failure, avalanche effect, and service blocking rate than a regular QKD network without the SDQTRF model.",A Novel Security Survival Model for Quantum Key Distribution Networks Enabled by Software-Defined Networking,,Shirko and  O; Askar and  S,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 14:34:28,

It stands between computer architecture and mathematics, as it relies strongly on variants of abstract interpretation. One of the features that causes the largest uncertainty regarding WCET evaluation for low-level analysis of sequential execution on a single processor is taking Cache Memory-related Delays (CMRD) and Cache-related Preemption Delays (CRPD) correctly into account. Research work from the 1990s provides a good basic framework for this problem as long as a task runs without preemption. But when preemption of tasks is allowed, although several formalisms exist, their predictive power is lower and the usual approach relies on analyses of NP-hard problems. In this article, we want to show some potential advantages of using a formalism inspired by Quantum Computing (QC) to evaluate CMRDs with preemptions while avoiding the NP-hard problem underneath. The experimental results, with a classic (non-quantum) numerical approach, on a selection of Malardalen benchmark programs display very good accuracy, while the complexity of the evaluation is a low-order polynomial of the number of memory accesses.

In order to execute corresponding quantum algorithms (usually provided in terms of quantum circuits), certain physical constraints in the architectures need to be satisfied. More precisely, physical constraints restrict the possible interactions between qubits which frequently result in cases where qubits which are supposed to interact in a quantum circuit are not allowed to interact on the physical device. Thus far, this is addressed by dedicated methods that map the logical quantum circuit to a physical realization and satisfy the constraints by inserting further operations. This leads to additional costs which harm the fidelity of the circuit and, hence, urgently need to be avoided. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art approaches for this mapping process take the existing architectures as invariant and only try to reduce the number of additionally needed operations. In contrast, (slight) changes in the, respectively, given architectures (which still keep the underlying physical constraints satisfied) might be possible and may allow for even better (i.e., less costly) mappings. But this potential has not been investigated yet. In this work, we explore this potential. More precisely, we introduce several schemes for generating alternative coupling graphs (and, by this, quantum computing architectures) that still might be able to satisfy physical constraints but, at the same time, allow for a more efficient realization of the desired quantum functionality.

The hydrodynamic analogue of this model is a flow in which the viscosity is absent and all rotational flow is carried by quantized vortices with identical topological line-structure and circulation. Numerical simulations start from an initial state containing a large number of quantized vortices and follow the chaotic vortex interactions leading to a vortex-tangle turbulent state. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved using a parallel (MPI-OpenMP) code based on a pseudo-spectral spatial discretization and second order splitting for the time integration. We define four quantum-turbulence simulation cases based on different methods used to generate initial states: the first two are based on the hydrodynamic analogy with classical Taylor-Green and Arnold-Beltrami-Childress vortex flows, while the other two methods use a direct manipulation of the wave function by generating a smoothed random phase field, or seeding random vortex-ring pairs.

We investigated using this paradigm to perform k-means clustering on near-term quantum computers, by casting it as a QAOA optimization instance over a small coreset. We used numerical simulations to compare the performance of this approach to classical k-means clustering.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a dung beetle search algorithm (QHDBO) based on quantum computing and a multi-strategy hybrid. The good point set strategy is used to initialize the initial population of dung beetles . That makes the initial population more evenly distributed, and reduces the likelihood of the algorithm falling into a local optimum solution. The convergence factor and dynamic balance between the number of Spawning and foraging dung beetles is proposed. That allows the algorithm to focus on the global search in the early stages and local exploration in the later stages. The quantum computing based t-distribution variation strategy is used to variate the optimal global solution, that prevents the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. To verify the performance of the QHDBO algorithm, this paper compares QHDBO with six other swarm intelligence algorithms through 37 test functions and practical engineering application problems.

In this paper, we consider delegation schemes for quantum circuits, where we try to minimize the quantum operations needed by the client. We construct a new scheme for delegating a large circuit family, which we call 'C+P circuits'. 'C+P' circuits are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates and diagonal gates. Our scheme is non-interactive, requires small amount of quantum computation from the client (proportional to input length but independent of the circuit size), and can be proved secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional assumptions, such as the existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice the random oracle can be replaced by an appropriate hash function or block cipher, for example, SHA-3, AES. This protocol allows a client to delegate the most expensive part of some quantum algorithms, for example, Shor's algorithm. The previous protocols that are powerful enough to delegate Shor's algorithm require either many client side quantum operations or the existence of FHE. The protocol requires asymptotically fewer quantum gates on the client side compared to running Shor's algorithm locally. To hide the inputs, our scheme uses an encoding that maps one input qubit to multiple qubits. We then provide a novel generalization of classical garbled circuits ('reversible garbled circuits') to allow the computation of Toffoli circuits on this encoding. We also give a technique that can support the computation of phase gates on this encoding. To prove the security of this protocol, we study key dependent message (KDM) security in the quantum random oracle model.

Indeed this machine solves a spin glass problem with programmable coefficients but subject to quite strong topology restrictions on the set of non-zero coefficients. Rather than mapping problem variables onto multiple qbits, an approach which requires many invocations of the annealer to solve small size problems, it is tempting to investigate the existence of sparse relaxations compliant with the qbits interconnection topology of the machine, hence solvable in one invocation of the annealing oracle, but still providing good-quality solutions to the original problem. This paper provides an experimental setup which aims to determine whether or not such convenient relaxations do exist or, rather, are easy to find. Our experiments suggest that it is not the case and, therefore, that solving even moderate size arbitrary problems with a single call to a quantum annealer is not possible at least within the constraints of the so-called Chimera topology.

The choice of a two-qubit (2Q) hardware basis gate depends on a quantum modulator's native Hamiltonian interactions and applied control drives. In this paper, we propose a collaborative design approach to select the best ratio of drive parameters that determine the best basis gate for a particular modulator. This requires considering the theoretical computing power of the gate along with the practical speed limit of that gate, given the modulator drive parameters. The practical speed limit arises from the couplers' tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied, for which some combinations can result in higher overall speed limits than others. Moreover, as this 2Q basis gate is typically applied multiple times in succession, interleaved by 1Q gates applied directly to the qubits, the speed of the 1Q gates can become a limiting factor for the quantum circuit, particularly as the pulse length of the 2Q basis gate is optimized. We propose parallel-drive to drive the modulator and qubits simultaneously, allowing a richer capability of the 2Q basis gate and in some cases for this 1Q drive time to be absorbed entirely into the 2Q operation. This allows increasingly short duration 2Q gates to be more practical while mitigating a significant source of overhead in some quantum systems.

Traditional optimization techniques such as latency hiding are not suitable for quantum simulation, and high-performance devices like GPGPUs cannot be fully utilized. This paper proposes DLC (Data Locality and Communication) optimizer to perform data locality and data layout optimizations. Both optimizations are based on the identification of amplitudes that can be processed by a sequence of quantum gates. They not only increase the data locality on the GPU side, but also reduces the date communication overheads and the times of data exchanges. In addition, layout data dynamically can significantly reduce the memory space on the GPGPU side for data communication. We evaluate our scheme on a small-scale CPU + GPU cluster.

39875109,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,Multi-attribute group decision making; Subjectivity; Quantum framework; Independence of decision maker,"Due to the increasing complexity of decision tasks, the experiences, knowledge or opinions from multiple decision makers (DMs) often need to be aggregated. Many multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approaches have been widely studied. In a MAGDM problem, the multiple DMs are usually regarded as independent. However, in many practical situations, the opinions from different DMs are likely to influence each other or to be affected by the environment. To address it, a quantum framework based on quantum probability theory is proposed in this paper. The goal is to model the subjectivity in MAGDM when we have subjective beliefs towards DMs' independence or relations. The modeled subjectivity sources from the interference of beliefs. However, in classical models, subjectivity usually comes from the preference of DMs when determining weights or giving an evaluation towards alternatives. In this paper, the classical MAGDM technics are used to do the preparation firstly. Then a Bayesian network is constructed and it is extended to a quantum framework. The beliefs toward DMs are in a superposition. Namely, the opinions of DMs are viewed as various wave functions that are occurring at the same time. Then the beliefs will interfere with each and influence the final result. When all the DMs are deemed independent, the quantum framework will degenerate into a classical Bayesian network. The various cases of a simple example have been discussed and analyzed. A real supplier section problem is also used to illustrate and validate our model. Finally, an overall comparative analysis regarding the subjectivity in MAGDM is performed.",A quantum framework for modelling subjectivity in multi-attribute group decision making,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Science and Technology on Avionics Integration Laboratory and Aviation Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),He and  ZC; Chan and  FTS; Jiang and  W,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 13:56:06,

Promoting green buildings in sustainable development is important to promote environment-friendly development. Considering this, we used the multi-player quantum game method to analyze the interest relationship between the developer, general construction contractor, and building materials supplier for the development of green-building and discussed the influence of the three on the game system. Furthermore, this study proposes a novel three-person quantum game model, discusses the optimal strategy selection process of the three parties with and without considering the entanglement, and uses a practical engineering case to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Without considering the entanglement of states, developers have the lowest willingness to invest in green-building, that is, the minimum investment of 28 million. When entanglement of states is considered and the initial state is |psi ini) = J|000), developers have the highest intention to invest in green buildings, that is, 56 million. Compared with the initial state of |psi ini) = J|111) when entanglement of states is not considered and entanglement of states is considered, developers'intention to invest in green-building shows an upward trend. The results show that entanglement can effectively prevent betrayal in the process of green-building construc-tion. Finally, according to the meaning of quantum entanglement and quantum strategy, an 'entanglement treaty' is constructed, aiming at reducing the occurrence of treachery and providing an important guarantee for encouraging green-building participants to actively participate in green-building development.

When it comes to cybersecurity, one of the key benefits of using machine learning is that it makes the detection of malware more effective, scalable, and actionable than traditional human approaches. This is one of the primary advantages of employing machine learning. The cybersecurity risks posed by quantum learning must be effectively managed on a logical and theoretical level in order to be mitigated. It is necessary to prevail over these obstacles. Deep learning, support vector quantums, and Bayesian classification are just a few examples of the quantum learning and statistical technologies that have showed promise in the area of reducing the consequences of cyberattacks. When designing intelligent security systems, it is essential to unearth previously unknown patterns and insights hidden within network data, as well as to develop a data-driven quantum learning model to counteract the threats posed by these attacks. Additionally, it is essential to uncover previously unknown patterns and insights hidden within network data.

Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with the number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a single quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions, which would be rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in terms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out the foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a subject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean polynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic Z/2(n)Z ring operations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which allows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits. For arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as Fourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features, such as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed integers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This representation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to any quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We discuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial encoder and finally supply a complexity estimation.

In this paper, we give a general framework for implementing quantum query algorithms efficiently in a Quantum CONGEST network, using the concept of parallel-query quantum algorithms. We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries in two settings: problems where data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical problems where the network defines the input. The first setting is slightly unusual in CONGEST but here our results follow almost directly from the quantum query setting. The second setting is more traditional for the CONGEST model but here our framework requires also some classical CONGEST steps to apply. In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can pick one of k dates for a meeting such that a maximum number of nodes is available, using (O) over tilde(root kD + D) rounds, with D the network diameter. The classical complexity is linear in k. We also give an efficient algorithm for element distinctness: if all nodes together holds a list of k numbers, we show that the nodes can determine whether there are any duplicates in (O) over tilde (k(2/3) D-1/3 + D) rounds. Classically this problem requires (Omega) over tilde (k + D) rounds. We also generalize the protocol for the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting considered by Buhrman, Cleve, and Wigderson [4] to general networks. This gives a novel separation between exact classical and exact quantum protocols in the CONGEST model. In the setting where the input is the network structure itself, our framework almost directly allows us to recover the O(root nD) round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez [21]. We extend this approach to also compute the radius in the same number of rounds, and to give an epsilon-additive approximation of the average eccentricity in (O) over tilde (D-3/2/epsilon) rounds. Finally, we give the first quantum speedups over classical CONGEST for the problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a graph has a cycle of length at most k in O(k + (kn)(1/2-1/Theta(k))) rounds. For girth computation, we give an (O) over tilde (g + (gn)(1/2-1/Theta(g))) round algorithm for graphs with girth g, beating the classical Omega(root n) round lower bound by Frischknecht, Holzer, and Wattenhofer [12].",A Framework for Distributed Quantum Queries in the CONGEST Model,"NWO/OCW, as part of QSC; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)",van Apeldoorn and  J; de Vos and  T,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:37:32,

Approximate computing is a novel computing paradigm that produces imprecise results by relaxing the need for fully precise output for error-tolerant applications including multimedia, data mining, and image processing. We investigate how approximate computing can improve the noise resilience of quantum adder circuits in NISQ quantum computing. We propose five designs of approximate quantum adders to reduce depth while making them noise-resilient, in which three designs are with carryout, while two are without carryout. We have used novel design approaches that include approximating the Sum only from the inputs (pass-through designs) and having zero depth, as they need no quantum gates. The second design style uses a single CNOT gate to approximate the SUM with a constant depth of O(1).

However, attacking wireless pilot signals has been a potential easy way to interrupt URLLC services. In this work, we propose a random structured code to encode and decode pilot signals on multidimensional physical resources, and also design a quantum learning framework to make this code secure and reliable. Specifically, the code suggests using random encoding with little structures to disperse the effect of attacks. We find that the decoding process can be modeled as a computing trap if the group spatial channel features are employed. The security problem is, therefore, transformed as random computing with redundancy. We employ a quantum algorithm to learn the computing trap model such that the computing redundancy can be removed quickly while the dispersed attack can be eliminated. In this respect, we can prove the existence of the quantum black-box model corresponding to the computing trap, and derive a precise expression of computing performance. Based on the result, we can formulate novel analytical closed-form expressions of system failure probability to characterize the reliability of the URLLC.

The proposed SQSC approach involves the design of Shifting and Binary Conversions (SBC) algorithm with two sub-processes namely shifting process and binary conversion. Since none of the works have been developed quantum channel in the current system to secure data, the proposed model added complexity to the secret data (shifting process and binary conversion using SBC) before q-bit conversion. The design of SBC algorithm to resolve side-channel attacks and accomplish improved security shows the novelty of the work.

The steps number of the quantum algorithm is inversely proportional to the square of the standard error epsilon 2 of the measured concurrence value, with no dependence on the input size ' n ' of each function.

To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on pulse optimization to suppress ZZ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved. To address the above problems, we propose a scalable approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an ability to suppress ZZ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods.

Using convenient data classification techniques and various circuit diagrams consisting of one quantum gate and several measurements, we were able to distinguish between these various circuits when executed at position n in the interim phase by training our classifier on data from probing circuits executed at queue positions n-1 and n+1. This shows that there is sufficient information residing in the data before and after a circuit is executed on a cloud-based superconducting quantum computer to allow an attacker to ascertain information about an otherwise unknown third-party circuit and shows potential to form the basis of a side-channel attack in cases where queue positions can be examined to target a third party's transpiled circuit during experimentation.

As our answer to this eminent but profound question, we first lay out a fundamental platform to carry out adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems (AEQSs) with limited computational resources (in size, energy, spectral gap, etc.) and then demonstrate how to construct such AEQSs by operating suitable families of quantum finite automata. We further explore fundamental structural properties of decision problems (as well as promise problems) solved quickly by the appropriately constructed AEQSs.

With the potential proliferation of universal quantum computers on the horizon, quantum computing, however, is still severely grounded by numerous grave barriers, which lead to its low accessibility and practicality. For example, the vastly different underlying computing models, combined with the steep background knowledge requirements, makes it extremely difficult, if possible at all, for most software engineering researchers and practitioners to even begin to design or implement quantum algorithms or softwares in practice. To overcome this problem, we, in this paper, propose a design that largely circumvents said accessibility and practicality barriers, by providing an end-to-end quantum computing framework for solving NP-complete problems via reduction. We fully implemented a toolkit under our design framework. With this toolkit, software engineering researchers and practitioners would be able to enjoy the speedup and scalability benefits of universal quantum computers without necessarily having to have prior knowledge on quantum computing.",Automatically Solving NP-Complete Problems on a Quantum Computer,,Hu and  SH; Liu and  P; Chen and  CF; Pistoia and  M,,o,,1,2024-02-21 17:39:27,

The main issue to be addressed in CGI technology is how to achieve rapid and high-quality imaging while assuring the secure transmission of detection data in practical distant imaging applications. In order to address the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a remote secure CGI method based on quantum communication technology. Using the quantum key distribution (QKD) network, the CGI system can be reconstructed while solving the problem of information security transmission between the detector and the reconstructed computing device. By exploring the influence of different random measurement matrices on the quality of image reconstruction, it is found that the randomness of the numerical sequence constituting the matrix is positively correlated with the imaging quality. Based on this discovery, a new type of quantum cryptography measurement matrix is constructed using quantum cryptography with good randomness. In addition, through further orthogonalization and normalization of the matrix, the matrix has both good randomness and orthogonality, and high-quality imaging results can be obtained at a low sampling rate. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by simulation imaging experiments. Compared with the traditional GI system, the method proposed in this paper has higher transmission security and high-quality imaging under this premise, which provides a new idea for the practical development of CGI technology.",A Remote Security Computational Ghost Imaging Method Based on Quantum Key Distribution Technology,Innovation Capacity Building Project of the Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission; Innovation Platform and Talent Project of Jilin Provincial Department of Science and Technology,Wu and  JA; Chen and  Y; Zhou and  C; Chen and  ZY; Xu and  CQ; Song and  LJ,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 1:41:26,

To achieve this goal, architectures that perform fault tolerance quantum computation (FTQC) with 3D cluster states have been designed; however, the current benchmarks for such constructions are still below general experimental requirements. In light of this, we propose a new 3D FTQC scheme by exploiting geometric tolerance to erasure errors using cluster states with novel lattice structures, specifically, by replacing the physical qubits with small-sized error detection codes that allow simple applications of logical CZ gates. We are able to locate Pauli errors locally and effectively convert them into loss errors. With a combination of code concatenation and multi-staged decoding, the scheme is able to achieve higher performance than traditional cubic lattices in protecting quantum information. We have surveyed a wide range of possible concatenation schemes and Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed on the decoders to study their respective scaling behavior. The scheme has demonstrated an overall decrement in active qubit overhead and an improvement of the error threshold, which varies from 10% to 160% depending on the noise model, indicating a relatively higher rate of fault tolerance compared with previous cluster states-based codes.",Erasure Decoding Scheme of Topological Fault Tolerance Quantum Computation With 3D Concatenation Codes,,Li and  ZY; Kim and  I; Hayden and  P,,o,,-1,2024-02-21 18:51:23,

In the first experiment, we try to find an arbitrary functional solution using iSOMA with minimal constraints on this circuit's design.

To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. That is, it allows a large set of different physical operations to be realized on the qubits, based on the input angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time. Studying this tradeoff is challenging because of the diversity in QC application requirements, the need to optimize applications for widely different hardware gate types and noise variations across gate types. Therefore, our work develops NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude.

The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability.

However, the deployment of VQAs on contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant noise and prohibitively slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive supporting resources and infrastructure make quantum computers extremely keen on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized way of building up a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on a single physical device which tends to introduce ever-changing device-specific noise with less reliable performance as time-since-calibration grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble, which dynamically distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices, and adjusts the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In addition to reduced machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide significant speedups for VQA training. With this idea, we build a novel VQA training framework called EQC - a distributed gradient-based processor-performance-aware optimization system - that comprises: (i) a system architecture for asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytical model for assessing the quality of a circuit output concerning its architecture, transpilation, and runtime conditions; (iii) a weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational contribution according to the systems' current performance.

Scheduling requires optimizing either single objective or multiple objectives. Load Imbalance (LIB) and Load balancing Cost Ratio (LCR) are two such objectives. LIB and LCR are used in deciding the distribution of load over available resources for utilization and the computational cost respectively. Scheduling jobs with precedence constraints are NP-complete in nature. Scheduling requires either heuristic or metaheuristic approach for sub-optimal but acceptable solutions. Quantum computing is one such meta heuristic approach. It has proven to be promising in addressing the multi-objective scheduling problems with an effective exploration of the search space. This work proposes a dual-objective Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm based Load Balancing Strategy (QGLBS) for workflow application with the objective of optimizing both LIB and LCR. The DAG representation of the batch of jobs helps in effective exploitation of the parallelism available at the job level as well as the sub job level with the modules at the same level of the batch executing at the same time. The strategy ensures that the communication cost and the critical path are considered in making scheduling decisions. QGLBS exploits the features of Quantum Computing and Genetic Algorithm to establish the Pareto fronts using non-dominated sorting based on NSGA-II. Hypervolume measures are used to compare the results of the quality assessment of Pareto fronts. Simulation study on Gridsim ensures that the QGLBS approach works effectively for real life scenario with various workflow applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In some cases, QC platforms offer the potential to vastly outperform the familiar classical computer by solving problems more quickly or that may be intractable on any known classical platform.

In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques like surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we virtualize logical qubits by storing them in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon. Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal application of CNOT operations between logical qubits sharing the same physical address (same set of cavities) which are 6x faster than standard lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves approximately 10x in transmons with another 2x savings from an additional optimization for compactness. Although qubit virtualization pays a 10x penalty in serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and in area efficiency result in fault-tolerance and performance comparable to conventional 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show our system can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional two-dimensional grids while saving substantial hardware. Furthermore, our architecture can produce magic states at 1.22x the baseline rate given a fixed number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers as magic states are essential and machines will spend the majority of their resources continuously producing them.

Noise in quantum gates limits the reliability of quantum circuits. To characterize the noise effects, prior methods such as process tomography, gateset tomography and randomized benchmarking have been proposed. However, the challenge is that these methods do not scale well with the number of qubits. Noise models based on the understanding of underneath physics have also been proposed to study different kinds of noise in quantum computers. The difficulty is that there is no widely accepted noise model that incorporates all different kinds of errors. The real-world errors can be very complicated and it remains an active area of research to produce accurate noise models. In this paper, instead of using noise models to estimate the reliability, which is measured with success rates or inference strength, we treat the NISQ quantum computer as a black box. We use several quantum circuit characteristics such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, the number of CNOT gates, and the connection topology of the quantum computer as inputs to the black box and derive a reliability estimation model using (1) polynomial fitting and (2) a shallow neural network. We propose randomized benchmarks with random numbers of qubits and basic gates to generate a large data set for neural network training.

This can involve tailoring problem formulations and algorithms to the quantum execution environment, but also entails the possibility of adapting physical properties of the QPU to specific applications. In this work, we follow the latter path, and investigate how key figures-circuit depth and gate count-required to solve four cornerstone NP-complete problems vary with tailored hardware properties.

This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation algorithms' performance to solve two common COP, namely the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem.

Protecting data with an error-correcting code necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially corrupted data set-a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding algorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner.

Based on that, we provide an implementation of a general decoder for QLDPC codes. On top of that, we propose a highly efficient heuristic decoder that eliminates the runtime bottlenecks of the general QLDPC decoder while still maintaining comparable decoding performance. These tools eventually make it possible to confirm theoretical results around QLDPC codes in a more practical setting and showcase the value of software tools (in addition to theoretical considerations) for investigating codes for practical applications.

Because classical data is encoded into quantum data with their exact values in value-encoded methods, in contrast to variational quantum circuits, arithmetical operations can be applied with high accuracy. In this study, value-encoded quantum circuits for convolution and pooling operations are proposed to apply deep learning in quantum computers in a traditional and proven way. To construct the convolution and pooling operations, some modules such as addition, multiplication, division, and comparison are created. In addition, a window-based framework for quantum image processing applications is proposed. The generated convolution and pooling circuits are simulated on the IBM QISKIT simulator in parallel thanks to the proposed framework. The obtained results are verified by the expected results.

We observe that the intermediate states of many trials can often be the same. Once these states are computed in one trial, they can be temporarily stored and reused in other trials. However, storing such states will consume significant memory space. To leverage the shared intermediate states without introducing too much storage overhead, we propose to statically generate and analyze the Monte Carlo simulation simulation trials before the actual simulation. Those trials are reordered to maximize the overlapped computation between two consecutive trials. The states that cannot be reused in follow-up simulation are dropped, so that we only need to store a few states.

Our DC analysis showed that in general, Write static noise margins of the SRAM cell improves when temperature changes from 300K to 8K, even at low-voltage condition. Regarding the Read static noise margin, our simulation showed that the inverters exhibit pseudo-static hysteresis and interestingly this leads to an improvement of read static noise margin of the cell, similar to what observed in a Schmitt-Trigger SRAM.

To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

Qubit measurement is typically the most error-prone operation on a quantum computer, with measurement errors ranging from 8% to 30% reported on current machines. This goal of this paper is to mitigate measurement errors by exploiting the state-dependent bias of measurement errors. Experiments on the IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14 machines show variation in measurement errors depending on the state being measured. For example, measuring an all-zero state on IBM-Q5 has a fidelity of 84%; however, the fidelity drops to 62% while measuring the all-one state. To improve measurement fidelity, we propose Invert-and-Measure, which transforms the system from a vulnerable state to a stronger state and then performs the measurement in the stronger state. We propose two designs for Invert-and-Measure. First, Static Invert-and-Measure (SIM), which executes two instances of the program, one with standard measurements and the other with inverted measurements and combines the results. Second, Adaptive Invert and Measure (AIM), which learns the relative bias of different states using runtime profiling and produces specialized inversions to increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct answer.

The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models transformed the OCL problems into a regression task. However, the abundant semantic information of the crowd scenes may lead the CNN framework hard to extract adequate features in order to ensure good precision In this work, a Quantum Image Feature Extraction with Dense Distribution-Aware Learning (QE-DAL) framework was proposed to handle this problem. The crowd features were extracted by Quantum layers, which were extracted by encoding, quantum circuits and decode procedures based on the multi-scale architecture. For handling objects, the refined distance compensating operator was adopted to fuse the multi-scale architecture. To relieve the computation burden, a Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism was proposed to initiate and update the bounding sizes of the objects via a point-supervised manner. Finally, the joint loss function, which describes pixel classes, density maps and offset bounding boxes, was built for QE-DAL. The ablation experiment results demonstrated that the effectiveness of the quantum feature extraction architecture and the Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism of QE-DAL was validated to show superior performance than the other state-of-the-art framework.

However, as the number and possible values of input parameters increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises. This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's search algorithm. This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O (N), where.. represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O (epsilon(-1)root N/K), where.. is a relative error of measuring... The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations.

We go over different types of protections and other theories to protect such attacks if and when they occur from a quantum computer. Our research paper also covers decryption comparing how classical computing decryption can be done manually or even automatically.

39875277,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,,"Josephson Junction (JJ) based superconductor logic families have been proposed and implemented to process analog and digital signals [1] for its low energy dissipation and ultrafast switching speed. Thanks to its construction of resistance-less wires and ultrafast switches, it can operate at clock frequencies of several tens of gigahertz and even hundreds of thousands of times as energy efficient as its CMOS counterparts. It has been perceived to be an important candidate to replace state-of-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency, as recognized by the U.S. IARPA C3 and SuperTools Programs and Japan MEXT-JSPS Project. The design and fabrication of superconducting circuits have already been established [2[44]. In addition, a prototype superconducting microprocessor 'Core 1' has been demonstrated in 2004 [3], which is able to execute instructions at a high clock frequency of several tens of gigahertz, and with extremely low-power dissipation. These achievements make superconducting electronics highly promising for future high-performance computing applications. As one of the most matured superconducting technology, the Rapid-Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) technology is proposed by K. Likharev, O. Mukhanoc, V. Semenov in 1985 [1]. Despite its capability to be operated at an ultra-high speed of hundreds of GHz while maintaining extremely low switching energy (10(-19)J), it suffers from an increasing static power due to on-chip resistors that are required for constant DC bias supply for the main RSFQ circuit. Numerous methods have been proposed to resolve the static power dissipation problem of RSFQ, including low-voltage RSFQ (LV-RSFQ) [5], reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) [6], LR-biased RSFQ [7] and energy-efficient single-flux quantum (eSFQ) [8]. The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) technology, on the other hand, uses AC bias/excitation currents as both multi-phase clock signal and power supply [9] to mitigate the power consumption overhead of DC bias while operating at a frequency of few GHz. Consequently, AQFP is remarkably energy efficient compared to RSFQ, albeit operating at a lower frequency. The energy-delay-product (EDP) of the AQFP circuits fabricated using processes such as the AIST standard process 2 (STP2) and the MIT-LL SFQ process [10], [11], is at least 200 times smaller than those of the other energy-efficient superconductor logics and is only three orders of magnitude larger than the quantum limit [9]. Physical testing results of an AQFP 8-bit carry-look-ahead adder and large scale circuits consisting up-to 10,000 AQFP logic gates have demonstrated the AQFP being a promising technology that is robust against circuit parameter variations [12]. Despite the high application potential of AQFP in VLSI circuits, a systematic, automatic synthesis framework for AQFP is imminent. There are two features of AQFP that restrict conventional CMOS synthesis methods being directly applied on AQFP. In spite of And-Or-Inverter(AOI) based representation, which conventional CMOS circuits highly relies on, AQFP circuits prefer majority gates. In fact, its two inputs AND and OR gates are also built with three inputs majority gate with one input being constant. In addition, given its clock-synchronized data propagation nature, AQFP technology requires all inputs to any gate having equal delay. In order to meet this balanced timing requirement, splitters and buffers need to be inserted to the circuit. As a matter of fact, some circuit size can be doubled even with optimum amount of buffers and splitters inserted. The buffer and splitter insertion method can have a huge impact on the overall resource consumption. As the design complexity increases, an unoptimized buffer and splitter insertion method could result in huge amount of unnecessary buffers and splitters added. In addition to a complete synthesis framework, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for AQFP design is also lacking. It is imminent to have an IDE for AQFP integrating tools that offer schematic and layout editor, simulation and analysis for better and more efficient AQFP design flow. In this paper, we propose a complete design tool for AQFP design including an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a complete majority based synthesis framework and a buffer and splitter insertion framework.we propose a majority gates synthesis framework for AQFP circuits that is capable of converting any AOI netlist to its corresponding MAJ netlist by mapping all feasible three-input sub-netlists to corresponding MAJ based implementations. In addition, we also propose an automated buffer and splitter insertion method that is capable of adding the optimum amount of buffers and splitters to any given gate-level netlist. The proposed method can find the minimum amount of buffers and splitters to inserted to achieve equal delay with any library limitation on the size of splitters. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods can deliver very optimized results. The majority conversion tool can reduce circuit size by an average of 16.47% and delay by 30.21% in average. The buffer and splitter insertion tool only introduces an average of 14.24% overhead in size and 4.70% delay with splitter fanout size limited to 4 compared to an unachievable ideal results with no limitations on splitter fan-out size. Overall, the balanced design in majority gates can be reduced by 23.85% and 29.54% in size and delay compared to its AND/OR/Inverter implemented counterpart.","IDE Development, Logic Synthesis and Buffer/Splitter Insertion Framework for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Superconducting Circuits","Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), via the U.S. Army Research Office",Cai and  RZ; Ma and  XL; Chen and  O; Ren and  A; Liu and  N; Yoshikawa and  N; Wang and  YZ,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 2:17:01,

When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to performance.

Despite the implementation of such management infrastructures, incidents or security breaches happen. Each incident has associated a level of severity and a set of mitigation controls, so in order to restore the ISMS, the appropriate set of controls to mitigate their damage must be selected. The time in which the ISMS is restored is a critical aspect. In this sense, classic solutions are efficient in resolving scenarios with a moderate number of incidents in a reasonable time, but the response time increases exponentially as the number of incidents increases. This makes classical solutions unsuitable for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled and even less appropriate for scenarios in which security management is offered as a service to several companies. This paper proposes a solution to the incident response problem that acts in a minimal amount of time for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled. It applies quantum computing, as a novel approach that is being successfully applied to real problems, which allows us to obtain solutions in a constant time regardless of the number of incidents handled.

Separately, Aaronson conjectured that there exists an oracle O such that BQP(O) not equal (BPPBQNC)(O). These conjectures are intriguing allusions to the unresolved potential of combining classical and low-depth quantum computation. In this work we show that the Welded Tree Problem, which is an oracle problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time as shown by Childs et al. (arXiv:quant-ph/0209131), cannot be solved in BPPBQNC, nor can it be solved in the class that Jozsa describes. This proves Aaronson's oracle separation conjecture and provides a counterpoint to Jozsa's conjecture relative to the Welded Tree oracle problem. More precisely, we define two complexity classes, HQC and JC whose languages are decided by two different families of interleaved quantum-classical circuits. HQC contains BPPBQNC and is therefore relevant to Aaronson's conjecture, while JC captures the model of computation that Jozsa considers. We show that the Welded Tree Problem gives an oracle separation between either of {JC, HQC} and BQP.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP).

Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers. Results: The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC. Conclusion: By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier.

With this aim, quantum reservoir computing (QRC) with Ising spin networks was recently introduced as a quantum version of classical reservoir computing. In turn, reservoir computing is a neuro-inspired machine learning technique that consists in exploiting dynamical systems to solve nonlinear and temporal tasks. We characterize the performance of the spin-based QRC model with the Information Processing Capacity (IPC), which allows to quantify the computational capabilities of a dynamical system beyond specific tasks. The influence on the IPC of the input injection frequency, time multiplexing, and different measured observables encompassing local spin measurements as well as correlations is addressed.

In this paper, we explore different lossy compression strategies to substantially shrink quantum circuit tensors in the QTensor package (a state-of-the-art tensor network quantum circuit simulator) while ensuring the reconstructed data satisfy the user-needed fidelity. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We propose a series of optimized pre- and post-processing steps to boost the compression ratio of tensors with a very limited performance overhead. (2) We characterize the impact of lossy decompressed data on quantum circuit simulation results, and leverage the analysis to ensure the fidelity of reconstructed data. (3) We propose a configurable compression framework for GPU based on cuSZ and cuSZx, two state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated lossy compressors, to address different use-cases: either prioritizing compression ratios or prioritizing compression speed. (4) We perform a comprehensive evaluation by running 9 state-of-the-art compressors on an NVIDIA A100 GPU based on QTensor-generated tensors of varying sizes. When prioritizing compression ratio, our results show that our strategies can increase the compression ratio nearly 10 times compared to using only cuSZ.

To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x.

A number of these enzymes has been biochemically characterized in detail because the potential of alkane hydroxylases to catalyse high added-value reactions is widely recognized.

However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which means that they are no longer suitable to manage such enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload.

Because of the radical shift in computing paradigms that quantum represents, we see an opportunity to study the unique needs people have when interacting with quantum systems, what we call Quantum HCI (QHCI). Based on interviews with experts in quantum computing, we identify four areas in which HCI researchers can contribute to the field of quantum computing. These areas include understanding current and future quantum users, tools for programming and debugging quantum algorithms, visualizations of quantum states, and educational materials to train the first generation of 'quantum native' programmers.",Thinking Too Classically: Research Topics in Human-Quantum Computer Interaction,,Ashktorab and  Z; Weisz and  JD; Ashoori and  M,,o,,0,2024-02-23 14:14:32,

Furthermore, photonic qubits are easy to manipulate and do not require particularly strongly sealed environments, making them an appealing platform for quantum computing. With the one-way model, the vision of a universal and large-scale quantum computer based on photonics becomes feasible. In one-way computing, the input state is not an initial product state vertical bar 0 >(circle plus n), but a so-called cluster state. A series of measurements on the cluster state's individual qubits and their temporal order, together with a feed-forward procedure, determine the quantum circuit to be executed. We propose a pipeline to convert a QASM circuit into a graph representation named measurement-graph (m-graph), that can be directly translated to hardware instructions on an optical one-way quantum computer.

Pyrazinamidase, activator for pyrazinamide, leads to resistance against the drug due to mutagenicity across the world. The present study aimed at the quantum mechanistic analysis of mutations in pyrazinamidase to gain insights into the mechanism of this enzyme. Quantum mechanical calculations were performed to analyse the effect of mutations at the metal coordination site using ORCA software program. Moreover, conformational changes in PZase binding cavity has also been analysed due to mutations of binding pocket residues using CASTp server. In order to elucidate the behaviour of the mutant pyrazinamidase, docking of PZA in the binding pocket of PZase was performed using AutoDock Vina. Analysis of results revealed that iron showed weak binding with the metal coordination site of the mutant proteins due to alteration in electron transfer mechanism. The binding cavity of the mutant PZase has undergone major conformational changes as the volume of pocket increased due to bulky R-chains of mutated amino acids. These conformational changes lead to weak binding of the drug at binding cavity of PZase and reduce the drug activation mechanism leading to increased drug resistance in the bacterial strains.

Electrical measurements were conducted to analyze the cryogenic body bias effect in terms of performance, reliability, and short-channel effect in two types of transistors: DRAM peripheral low Vth transistors (Peri LVT) and buried-channel-array transistors (BCAT). At 77 K, the V-th shift (Delta V-th) in BCAT was larger than that in Peri LVT due to the difference in channel doping concentration. It was observed that only BCAT experienced a decrease in saturation drain current (I-d.sat) at cryogenic temperature because of the large Delta V-th. To compensate for the Delta V-th, FBB was applied to transistors. As a result, FBB effectively controlled the Vth and improved carrier mobility. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that FBB reduced hot-carrier degradation (HCD) at cryogenic temperature and improved short-channel effect, such as drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). These findings offer valuable solutions for optimizing cryogenic memory operation in quantum computing applications.",Cryogenic Body Bias Effect in DRAM Peripheral and Buried-Channel-Array Transistor for Quantum Computing Applications,Semiconductor Industry Collaborative Project between the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH),You and  H; Nam and  K; An and  J; Park and  C; Kim and  D; Lee and  S; Lee and  N; Baek and  RH,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 21:39:49,

The main focus of this paper is on quantum computing technologies, as they can in the most direct way benefit from developing tools enabling the symbolic manipulation of quantum circuits and providing software tools for creating, optimizing, and testing quantum programs. We deliver a short survey of the most popular approaches in the field of quantum software development, pointing their strengths and weaknesses. This helps to formulate a list of desirable characteristics which should be included in quantum computing frameworks. Next, we describe a software architecture and its preliminary implementation supporting the development of quantum programs using symbolic approach, encouraging the functional programming paradigm, and, at the same, time enabling the integration with high-performance and cloud computing.

Execution of a quantum gate in multiple trap TI system may frequently involve ions from two different traps, hence one of the ions needs to be shuttled (moved) between traps to be co-located, degrading fidelity, and increasing the program execution time. The choice of initial mapping influences the number of shuttles. The existing Greedy policy neglects the depth of the program at which a gate is present. Intuitively, the contribution of the late-stage gates to the initial mapping is less since the ions might have already shuttled to a different trap to satisfy other gate operations. In this paper, we target this gap and propose a new program adaptive policy especially for programs with considerable depth and high number of qubits (valid for practical-scale quantum programs). Our technique achieves an average reduction of 9% shuttles/program (with 21.3% at best) for 120 random circuits and enhances the program fidelity up to 3.3X (1.41X on average).",A Shuttle-Efficient Qubit Mapper for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Penn State ICDS; Huck Institute of the Life Sciences,Upadhyay and  S; Saki and  AA; Topaloglu and  RO; Ghosh and  S,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 20:46:40,

However, large-scale simulation of chemical systems on quantum computers is currently hindered due to a mismatch between the computational resource needs of the program and those available in today's technology. In this paper we argue that significant new optimizations can be discovered by co-designing the application, compiler, and hardware. We show that multiple optimization objectives can be coordinated through the key abstraction layer of Pauli strings, which are the basic building blocks of computational chemistry programs. In particular, we leverage Pauli strings to identify critical program components that can be used to compress program size with minimal loss of accuracy. We also leverage the structure of Pauli string simulation circuits to tailor a novel hardware architecture and compiler, leading to significant execution overhead reduction by up to 99%. While exploiting the high-level domain knowledge reveals significant optimization opportunities, our hardware/software framework is not tied to a particular program instance and can accommodate the full family of computational chemistry problems with such structure.

In the past, the optimized inversion implementation has been actively studied in modern computers. However, there are very few works to optimize the inversion on the quantum computer. In this paper, we present the optimized implementation of binary field inversion in quantum circuits. Reversible and non-reversible multiplication circuits are finely combined to reduce the number of CNOT gate. In particular, we optimized the reversible circuit for A . B and A . C case in the inversion operation. Afterward, the multiplication and squaring routine efficiently initializes some of the qubits used for the routine into zero value. Lastly, the-state-of-art multiplication and squaring implementation techniques, such as Karatsuba algorithm and shift-based squaring are utilized to obtain the optimal performance. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed implementation, the inversion is applied to the substitute layer of AES block cipher.

Its potential use in High Energy Physics has lead CERN, one of the top world users of large-scale distributed computing, to start programmes such as the Quantum Technology Initiative (QTI) to further assess and explore the applications of QC. As a part of QTI, CERN offered, in November-December 2020, a free, online series of lectures on quantum computing. In this paper, we report on the experience of designing and delivering these lectures, evaluating them in the broader context of computing education and training. Traditional textbooks and courses on QC usually focus on physical concepts and assume some knowledge of advanced mathematical and physical topics from the student. Our lectures were designed with the objective of reducing the prerequisites to the bare minimum as well as focusing on hands-on, practical aspects of programming quantum computers and not on the mathematical analysis of the algorithms. This also allowed us to include contents that are not usually covered in introductory courses, such as quantum machine learning and quantum annealing. The evaluation of the reception of the lectures shows that participants significantly increased their knowledge, validating the proposed approach not focused on mathematics and physics but on algorithmic and implementation aspects.",A report on teaching a series of online lectures on quantum computing from CERN,"Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness from Spain/FEDER; Regional Ministry of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias)",Combarro and  EF; Vallecorsa and  S; Rodr?guez-Mu?iz and  LJ; Aguilar-Gonz?lez and  A; Ranilla and  J; Meglio and  AD,,o,,-1,2024-02-23 2:09:08,

Two participant parties Alice and Bob, with the help of a semi-trusted third party and cloud device by simple quantum measurements and mathematical operation, can compare the equality of their secret information without revealing the content of secret information. We show that our protocol can resist the eavesdropper Eve's intercept-resend attack, entangle-measure attack, and Trojan horse attack to cloud device, participant's intercept-measure-resend attack, and third party's attack.
