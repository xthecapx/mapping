The mechanism of the quantum dot formation is not strain relaxation but the growth characteristic of (111)B GaAs under low substrate temperatures. When the growth is performed at low temperatures, the layer-by-layer growth mode is replaced by island growth and therefore quantum dots are formed. The formation of the quantum dots was verified by atomic force microscope (AFM) images and the shift of photoluminescence (PL). The PL emission from the quantum dots was very strong and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the emission peak was as small as 7.7 meV, indicating excellent quality and very uniform dot formation. The effect of nominal thickness on the quantum dot formation has been investigated.","Photoluminescence study of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots on (111)B GaAs substrates","JAPAN J APPLIED PHYSICS","Tsai and  FY; Lee and  CP","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:08:27,,,,

Many attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an answer (Harrah in Philos Sci 28:40???46, 1961, [1]). In this work, we have attempted to understand questions in a better way by using Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The properties of Quantum Computing (QC) have enabled classically intractable data processing. So, in this paper, we have performed question classification on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering) dataset using quantum-based classifier algorithms???quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe significant performance improvement. Hence, this experiment has helped in improving the quality of QA in general. ?? 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Implications of Deep Circuits in Improving Quality of Quantum Question Answering","Scopus: Stud.

It is further shown that the G3 results have a more regular systematic error and as a consequence a simpler model may be used to correct for systematic deviations. It is seen that the resulting enthalpy of formation values are in good agreement with the available experimental data, and that the predictions are sufficiently robust to point out certain errors in experimental determinations.

This synthetic route relies on a heavily Pb-rich condition or a large Pb:Cs molar ratio in precursor solution to produce QDs with appropriate stoichiometry as well as to guarantee a good colloidal stability. The high Pb condition is achieved by a high concentration of PbI2 prepared in TOP. Here we find such Pb-rich strategies can be avoided by providing additional iodine ions using other metal halide salts. In particular GeI2, which contrary to PbI2, readily dissolves in TOP. CsPbI3 QDs prepared using PbI2/GeI2 combination show near-unity PL QY and improved chemical stability compared to the previous synthetic route.

Signatures of Weyl fermion transport, i.e., unsaturated linear positive magnetoresistance accompanied by a quantum oscillation having a high quantum mobility of 10 000cm(2)/Vs and a pi Berry phase, were observed in films with thicknesses as small as 10nm. Residual resistivity increased with the decreasing film thickness indicating disorder near the interface between SrRuO3 and the SrTiO3 substrate. Since this disorder affects the magnetic and electrical properties of the films, the Curie temperature decreases and the coercive field increases with the decreasing thickness. Thickness-dependent magnetotransport measurements revealed that the threshold residual resistivity ratio to observe Weyl fermion transport is 21.

In the QDs family, lead Halide Perovskites (HPs) QDs are especially recognized for excellent Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PLQY,70%similar to 100%),ambipolar carrier transport,wide color gamut (150% NTSC) and low-cost solution synthesis process,making them as promising materials for Light-Emitting Diodes(LEDs)toward high-performance lighting and displays. Compared to the organic- inorganic lead HPs (MAPbX(3) and FAPbX(3),X=Cl,Br and I),all-inorganic cesium-lead HPs(CsPbX3)possess relatively higher stability and comparable optical properties,are more promising to fabricate devices for practical application. Since the first LEDs using CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots(QDs) emitters,the PLQY and stability of QDs have been continually increasing. Despite the rapid improvement in terms of PLQY and stability,the mass synthesis of perovskites QDs has been seldom studied but very crucial for applications. In order to overcome the performance degradation of inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) QDs during materials preparation with large quantities, a modified supersaturated recrystallization solution- process was proposed to prepare high-quality CsPbBr3 QDs at room temperature. By adding hydrobromic acid(HBr) to accelerate the dissolution of the perovskite precursor,and introducing Lewis acid ligand to partially replace oleylamine(OAm),to realize the effective passivation of surface defect of CsPbBr3 QDs. This method enables the synthesis of highly efficient luminescent CsPbBr3 QDs with low cost and mass production. The experiment results show that the CsPbBr3 QDs exhibit an emission peak at 517 nm with a narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)of 17 nm. Meanwhile,the PLQY of the CsPbBr3 QDs is measured to be as high as 95%. The X- Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbBr3 QDs show that its characteristic peaks located at 15.49 degrees(100),21.85 degrees(110),30.98 degrees(200),38.17 degrees(211),44.15 degrees(220),which indicated the typical monoclinic structure of the CsPbBr3 QDs (JCPDS No. 18-0364). The X- ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) implied the CsPbBr3 QDs showed Br- rich composition, which the rich Br in CsPbBr3 QDs probably contributes to the excellent optical properties and good air-stability properties in the ambient environment. As a proof-of-concept device,a backlit White Light Emitting- Diode(WLED)was fabricated based on the CsPbBr3 QDs. A mixture of the green CsPbBr3 QDs and commercially available red phosphor functioned as the downconverters,and separated high-energy GaN blue light sources for photoexcitation,applied to emit white light. Consequently,the WLED device shows a luminous efficacy of 48.35 lm/W under an operating current of 20 mA. Meanwhile,the WLED exhibited a typical Electroluminescence (EL) spectra which contain three emission peaks,454 nm peak of blue chip,517 nm peak of green CsPbBr3,and 620 nm peak of red phosphor,resperctively.

To scrutinize the root mechanism for degradation, several electro-optical measurements have been performed. The obtained results imply that (i) the rectification ratio diminishes largely after stress treatment, suggesting that leakage current and resistive effects are improved; (ii) both open-circuit voltage (VOC), and short-circuit current density (JSC) decline sharply within the first few hours (<50 h) of stress, after that degradation rates for VOC, and JSC slow down when stress time increases to 340 h, suggesting the physical processes responsible for degradation are altered after certain stress time; (iii) the spectral responsivity (R lambda), particularly at 384 (peak value) and below 347 nm reduce due to stress, indicating generation of deep levels associated with donors in n-GaN, and formation of severe point defects within MQWs lower the value of R lambda, whilst worsening of p-GaN quality ruin the detection capability below 347 nm; and (iv) the photo-response time changes due to acute carrier trapping during stress.

Quantum dots represent a novel, emission-tunable luminescent material for optimizing the sunlight spectrum in greenhouses with minimal intensity loss, ultimately enabling improved light use efficiency of plant growth without requiring electricity. In this study, greenhouse films containing CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots were utilized to absorb and convert ultraviolet and blue photons from sunlight to a photoluminescent emission centered at 600 nm. To analyze the effects of the quantum dot film spectrum on plant production, a 25-week tomato trial was conducted in Dutch glass greenhouses. Plants under the quantum dot film experienced a 14% reduction in overall daily light integral, resulting from perpendicular photosynthetically active radiation transmission of 85.3%, mainly due to reflection losses. Despite this reduction in intensity, the modified sunlight spectrum and light diffusion provided by the quantum dot film gave rise to 5.7% improved saleable production yield, nearly identical total fruiting biomass production, 23% higher light use efficiency (g/mol), 10% faster vegetative growth rate, and 36% reduced tomato waste compared to the control, which had no additional films. Based on this result, materials incorporating quantum dots show promise in enabling passive, electricity-free spectrum modification for improving crop production in greenhouse cultivation, but extensive controlled crop studies are needed to further validate their effectiveness.","Luminescent quantum dot films improve light use efficiency and crop quality in greenhouse horticulture","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","Hebert and  D; Boonekamp and  J; Parrish and  CH; Ramasamy and  K; Makarov and  NS; Casta??eda and  C; Schuddebeurs and  L; McDaniel and  H; Bergren and  MR","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:20:19,,,,

The paper presents results of the experimental and theoretical studies on cesium distribution effect along the vapor cell walls of quantum rotation sensor on the quality of parametric resonance in cesium. Methods. Theoretical and experimental studies were performed using the mathematical model, quantum rotation sensor layout and the laboratory setup for the vapor cell parameters research. The mathematical model was used for calculation of cesium relaxation rate theoretical value at various temperatures and further comparison of these data with experimental ones. For the experimental determination of cesium relaxation rate, the data on the parametric resonance width in cesium obtained on the of the quantum rotation sensor model were used. Studies of the cell optical properties were carried out on a laboratory setup in non-resonant light. A laser with a vertical emitter similar to the one used in the quantum rotation sensor is applied as a source of non-resonant light, tuned away from the nominal wavelength. The optimal detuning of the optical radiation frequency from the cesium resonance was determined on the laboratory setup, that reduces the dependence of the measurement results on the cell temperature. Selection of laser radiation optimal parameters is performed for the normal mode of the laser operation and freedom from fluctuations in its power and polarization. Main Results. During the research it was shown that undesirable cesium redistribution in the vapor cell leads to the optical paths transparency change, which causes the deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio and the decrease in the resonance line quality factor. In addition, it was shown that cesium resonance line broadening due to sedimentation of the cesium vapor on the cell walls is insignificant and is at the level of the measurement error. Practical Relevance. We have proposed and tested non-resonant light intensity control method for the laser emitter after passing through a vapor cell. This method provides for an operative state monitoring of the optical pumping channels and detecting of quantum rotation sensor layout. ??

Although the synthetic strategies for size control are well established and widely applicable to various QD systems, the structural characteristics of QDs, such as morphology and crystallinity, are tuned mostly by trial and error in a material-specific manner. Here, we show that reaction temperature and precursor reactivity, the two parameters governing the surface-reaction kinetics during growth, govern the structural quality of QDs. For conventional precursors, their reactivity is determined by their chemical structure. Therefore, a variation of precursor reactivity requires the synthesis of different precursor molecules. As a result, existing precursor selections often have significant gaps in reactivity or require synthesis of precursor libraries comprising a large number of variants. We designed a sulfur precursor employing a boron-sulfur bond, which enables controllable modulation of their reactivity using commercially available Lewis bases. This precursor chemistry allows systematic optimization of the reaction temperature and precursor reactivity using a single precursor and grows high-quality QDs from cores of various sizes and materials. This work provides critical insights into the nanoparticle growth process and precursor designs, enabling the systematic preparation of high-quality QD of any sizes and materials.

Borophene is the lightest two-dimensional (2D) layered material, with high carrier mobility and high hardness. In this work, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique was developed to prepare borophene quantum dots (BQDs) with uniform size, good dispersion, and high stability. The use of BQDs as a surface passivation agent on the TiO2 layer in an inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell was presented. It is found that the boron atoms undergo strong interactions with TiO2 and the perovskite, reducing interfacial recombination and forming a cascade energy alignment for effective charge transport. A CsPbI2Br solar cell with a thin BQD interlayer shows high efficiency of 15.31%, whereas the efficiency was 14.24% for the device with no BQDs. The enhancement in efficiency is mainly due to carrier recombination suppression and a decrease in the defect density at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface after BDQ treatment. This work demonstrates that high-quality BQDs have great potential to be applied in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.","High-quality borophene quantum dot realization and their application in a photovoltaic device","ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY","Zhao and  AR; Han and  Y; Che and  YH; Liu and  Q; Wang and  XY; Li and  Q; Sun and  J; Lei and  ZB; He and  XX; Liu and  ZH","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:22:10,,,,

The decrease occurred on time scales of hours to weeks, for non-hydrogenated and postgrowth hydrogenated films. The high QPY values were regenerated by repeating the hydrogenation process.

Early methods for synthesizing InP QDs employed tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine and tris(dimethylamino)phosphine as phosphorus sources. However, the associated toxicity and hazards of these sources have hindered further progress. In this study, we introduce tripyrrolidine phosphine as a safe alternative phosphorus source. This source not only guarantees affordability, but also simplifies recycling and hazardous waste treatment processes. Simultaneously, precise regulation of the Zn precursor during the growth of the ZnS shell has enabled the synthesis of InP QDs of exceptional quality with a prominent emission peak at 525 nm, an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 76.11 %, and a narrow half-peak width of 37 nm.

QDs bear a huge potential for numerous applications thanks to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, stability and processability are essential for their successful use in these applications. Incorporating QDs into a tight and chemically robust ionic matrix is one possible approach to increase both their stability and processability. With the proposed liquid-liquid diffusion-assisted crystallization (LLDC), substantially accelerated ionic crystallization of the QDs is shown, reducing the crystallization time needed by one order of magnitude. This fast process allows to incorporate even the less stable colloids including initially oil-based ligand-exchanged QDs into salt matrices.

While large-scale universal quantum computers are likely decades away, special-purpose quantum computational hardware has begun to emerge, which will become more powerful over time, as well as small-scale universal quantum computers. ?? 2016","A NASA perspective on quantum computing: Opportunities and challenges","Scopus: Parallel ComputArticleFinal","Biswas and  Rupak (7102076812); Jiang and  Zhang (55490139800); Kechezhi and  Kostya (57192995593); Knysh and  Sergey (6507357574); Mandr?? and  Salvatore (35223630100); O'Gorman and  Bryan (56045986700); Perdomo-Ortiz and  Alejandro (35747037700); Petukhov and  Andre (35568543600); Realpe-G??mez and  John (24335989500); Rieffel and  Eleanor (6602264636); Venturelli and  Davide (36447652300); Vasko and  Fedir (7005945237); Wang and  Zhihui (57209621792)","",o,,1,2024-03-31 20:26:43,,,,

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.","Quantum Software Components and Platforms: Overview and Quality Assessment","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","Serrano and  MA; Cruz-Lemus and  JA; Perez-Castillo and  R; Piattini and  M","",o,,1,2024-03-31 20:26:50,,,,

Optical communication networks offer various metrics, including high transmission capacity, efficient anti-interference, minimum transmission loss and robustness, and so on, that offer opportunities for communication networks. To satisfy the optical network demands, effective network resource utilization is essential. Therefore, developing a tool with improved Quality of Transmission (QoT) accuracy in optical networks is necessary. Recently, Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have provided various opportunities to resolve these issues and the deep learning (DL) algorithms offer improved performance over the conventional methods. This paper developed a novel DL-based cognitive QoT prediction model for Quantum optical communication networks. This proposed model predicts the QoT for the QoS (Quality of Service) setup using the DL model with the transmission computation. The proposed model utilized an optimized DL model called CNN-LSTM for the prediction process using the signal and link characteristics as input features. The DL model is trained using the transmission equations. The hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using frog leap optimization to improve the predictive performance. The experimental results highlight the enhanced and improved version of the proposed model, and the results are compared with the conventional systems in terms of performance measures.","Quantum optical techniques for quality data transmission process in cognitive networks","SPRINGER","Zeng and  Y","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:27:05,,,,

These water-soluble QDs were prepared using different capping agents including 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and L-cysteine (L-Cys). The photoluminescence (PL) intensity and stability of L-Cys-capped CdTexSe1-x QDs were found to be higher than that of MPA-stabilized ones.

However, most of the GQDs synthesized by existing methods face limitations due to the harmful chemicals involved in their synthesis and the presence of various oxygen functional groups, both of which affect the biocompatibility of the GQDs. Here, we present a simple approach to fabricating fluorescent and biocompatible high-quality GQDs with low oxygen content without the involvement of harmful chemicals. High-quality GQDs are synthesized by hydrogen-assisted pyrolysis of silicon carbide and this dry synthesis process allows the GQDs to possess high crystallinity with no unwanted chemicals on the surface. Subsequently, the high-quality GQDs are slightly oxidized through sonication in ethanol, but the treated GQDs (t-GQDs) still retain their high crystallinity. The t-GQDs exhibit strong ultraviolet/blue light emission with a high yield of 30.9%, a phenomenon that can be attributed to intrinsic emission resulting from the low oxygen content of the t-GQDs. Furthermore, the t-GQDs show low cytotoxicity even at a high concentration of 200 mg/mL due to the absence of harmful chemicals during their synthesis and the low oxygen content of the t-GQDs. These results demonstrate the excellence of the t-GQDs and their applicability in bio-fields. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to their unique chemical and physical properties, QDs offer huge potential for lighting applications. Nevertheless, both emission stability and processability of the QDs are limited upon usage from solution. Incorporating them into a solid ionic matrix overcomes both of these drawbacks, while preserving the initial optical properties. Here borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O) is used as a host matrix because of its lower solubility and thereby reduced ionic strength in water in comparison with NaCl. This guarantees the stability of high-quality CdSe/ZnS QDs in the aqueous phase during crystallization and results in a 3.4 times higher loading amount of QDs within the borax crystals compared to NaCl. All steps from the synthesis via mixed crystal preparation to the warm-white LED preparation are verified by applying the model-experimental feedback, in which experimental data and numerical results provide feedback to each other recursively. These measures are taken to ensure a high luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) and a high color rendering index (CRI) of the final device as well as a correlated color temperature (CCT) comparable to an incandescent bulb. By doing so, a warm-white LED with a LER of 341 lm/W-opt a CCT of 2720 K and a CRI of 91.1 is produced. Finally, we show that the emission stability of the QDs within the borax crystals on LEDs driven at high currents is significantly improved.

In this paper, a novel strategy to obtain GQDs is proposed and demonstrated by an ion-beam assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ion-beam irradiation provides catalyst sources for the GQD creation. The luminescent GQDs are generated using a Fe-implanted Si wafer by a two-step annealing process: i) A formation step of nano-sized Fe catalyst particles and ii) a synthesis step of GQDs by a CVD method. Under the 1st annealing step of the Fe-implanted Si wafer, Fe nano particles (FeNPs) are created by the diffusion and aggregation of Fe atoms. Due to the high temperature atmosphere in the 2nd annealing step, FeNPs are then completely removed, and thus only high-purity and-quality GQDs are finally produced. In our work, patterned GQDs were fabricated by using a metallic mask during the ion-beam irradiation.

For example, a warm white shade is desirable for indoors, corresponding to correlated color temperatures ???4000 K, together with color rendering indices ???90. Additionally, the luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) should be high, preferably ???380 lm/W opt. Conventional white LEDs cannot currently satisfy these requirements simultaneously. On the other hand, color-conversion white LEDs (WLEDs) integrated with quantum dots (QDs) can simultaneously reach such high levels of photometric and colorimetric performance. However, their electrical efficiency performance and limits have been unknown. To understand their potential of luminous efficiency (lm/Welect), we modeled and studied different QD-WLED architectures based on layered QD films and QD blends, all integrated on blue LED chips. The architecture of red, yellow and green emitting QD films (in this order from the chip outwards) is demonstrated to outperform the rest. In this case, for photometrically efficient spectra, the maximum achievable LE is predicted to be 327 lm/W elect.

As additives, CdSe QDs help promote the nucleation process in the initial stage of perovskite formation. In addition, it is revealed that the surface ligands of QDs also have an essential influence on the subsequent crystal growth of the perovskite film. The bifunctional ligands on the surface of QDs are beneficial in delaying the growth process of perovskite due to the free functional groups at the ends. The CsPbl 2 Br film prepared with bifunctional organic ligand-capped CdSe QD additives shows better crystallinity than that of the inorganic ligand-based one due to the dual function of these kinds of QDs in not only promoting nucleation but also retarding crystal growth of CsPbl(2)Br crystals.

Herein, liquid-phase-exfoliated black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) are incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution as additives to direct the formation of the perovskite film, i.e., methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). It is found that the perovskite films made with BPQDs have higher crystallinity and less nonradiative detects compared with the pristine ones, leading to longer carrier lifetime and higher carrier collection efficiency. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectra and surface density calculation of BPQDs reveal that the improvement of the perovskite film quality may be related to the heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite film at the BPQDs. PVSCs using MAPbI(3) films made with BPQDs achieve a maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.0% and an encouraging thermal stability of T-80 = 100 h at 100 degrees C. Both values are remarkably higher than the devices with pristine perovskite films.

40690773,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,"Perovskite solar cell; MXene quantum dot; Power conversion efficiency; Charge transport; Defect density; Nonradiative recombination","Recently, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) find applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), due to their high conductivity, tunable electronic structures, and rich surface chemistry, etc. However, the integration of 2D MXenes into PSCs is limited by their large lateral sizes and relatively-small surface volume ratios, and the roles of MXenes in PSCs are still ambiguous. In this paper, zero-dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots (MQDs) with an average size of 2.7 nm are obtained through clipping step by step combining a chemical etching and a hydrothermal reaction, which display rich terminals (i.e.,-F, -OH,-O) and unique optical properties. The 0D MQDs incorporated into SnO2 electron transport layers (ETLs) of PSCs exhibit multifunction: 1) increasing the electrical conductivity of SnO2, 2) promoting better alignments of energy band positions at the perovskite/ETL interface, 3) improving the film quality of atop polycrystalline perovskite. Particularly, the MQDs not only tightly bond with the Sn atom for decreasing the defects of SnO2, but also interact with the Pb2+ of perovskite. As a result, the defect density of PSCs is significantly decreased from 5.21 x 1021 to 6.4 x 1020 cm-3, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced nonradiative recombination.Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is substantially improved from 17.44% to 21.63% using the MQDs-SnO2 hybrid ETL compared with the SnO2 ETL. Besides, the stability of the MQDs-SnO2-based PSC is greatly enhanced, with only-4% degradation of the initial PCE after storage in ambient condition (25 degrees C, RH: 30-40%) for 1128 h, as compared to that of the reference device with a rapid degradation of-60% of initial PCE after 460 h. And MQDs-SnO2-based PSC also presents higher thermal stability than SnO2-based device with continuous heating for 248 h at 85 degrees C. The unique MQDs exhibited in this work might also find other exciting applications such as light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and fluorescent probes.","Multi-functional MXene quantum dots enhance the quality of perovskite polycrystalline films and charge transport for solar cells","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","Nie and  JL; Niu and  BQ; Wang and  YJ; He and  Z; Zhang and  XM; Zheng and  HH; Lei and  YM; Zhong and  P; Ma and  XH","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:35:22,,,,

Previously fabricated QD nanopillar arrays showed significant degradation of optical properties due to the etch damage. Here, a novel mass transport process in a Riber 3200 was performed to encapsulate the lithographically defined InGaAs disk QDs in a GaAs matrix, resulting in the passivation of the etch-damaged QD sidewall layer. Photoluminescence emission intensity following the mass transport process increased by a magnitude of 4-10 as compared to that from unprocessed nanopillar sample. In addition, a PL peak energy redshift was observed after mass transport, presumably due to the decrease in the lateral barrier potential from vacuum to GaAs, as well as the elimination of the depletion layer. Furthermore, the mass transport process in the high vacuum MBE environment enables GaAs overgrowth with few defects and dislocations following mass transport for surface planarization. PL emission intensity increased by an additional factor of 4 following GaAs overgrowth, bringing the QD intensity to 1/2 of that of the original single quantum well. Thus, the potential of the MBE-assisted mass transport process has been demonstrated to fabricate high optical quality InGaAs quantum dots encapsulated in a GaAs matrix for device applications.

In recent years, there has been much interest in studying such a strong coupling in the limit of single emitters. However, the lossy nature of PCs, reflected in their broad spectra, limits their quality factors and hence their performance as cavities. Here, we study the effect of the adhesion layer used in the fabrication of metal nanostructures on the spectral linewidths of bowtie-structured PCs. Using dark-field microspectroscopy, as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy, it is found that a reduction in the thickness of the chromium adhesion layer we use from 3 nm to 0.1 nm decreases the linewidths of both bright and dark plasmonic modes. We further show that it is possible to fabricate bowtie PCs without any adhesion layer, in which case the linewidth may be narrowed by as much as a factor of 2. Linewidth reduction increases the quality factor of these PCs accordingly, and it is shown to facilitate reaching the strong-coupling regime with semiconductor quantum dots.","Improving the quality factors of plasmonic silver cavities for strong coupling with quantum emitters","AIP Publishing","Bitton and  O; Gupta and  SN; Cao and  Y; Vaskevich and  A; Houben and  L; Yelin and  T; Haran and  G","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:35:34,,,,

For high transition temperature (high-T-c) rf SQUID, dielectric resonator is presently one of the most practical tank circuits. By growing YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) superconducting thin film on (100) SrTiO3 substrate with a pulsed-laser deposition technique and then patterning the YBCO thin film into flux concentrator with a washer structure, a series of dielectric resonators with unloaded quality factor Q(0) ranging from 200 to 6000 has been prepared. Surface morphology and electrical transport measurements have been carried out to investigate the dependence of Q(0) on the property of the YBCO thin film, which suggests that it is effective to boost the Q(0) of the resonator through improvements in both the crystalline quality and the superconductivity of the thin film. By integrating the resonators with the same SQUID chip, a set of YBCO rf SQUIDs has been assembled to explore the influence of Q(0) of the resonator on the performance of the rf SQUID. It is observed that the white noise of the device decreases substantially with the increase of Q(0), in accordance with the theoretical suggestion. Moreover, as Q(0) rises, the low frequency noise of the device is shown to reduce as well, revealing the importance of the high-Q(0) resonator in depressing the noise of the high-T-c rf SQUID over the entire frequency range. With the resonator of Q(0) = 6000, the YBCO rf SQUID at 77 K exhibits a field sensitivity of 50 fT/Hz(1/2) in the white noise region, 58 fT/Hz(1/2) and 110 fT/Hz(1/2) at 10 Hz and 1 Hz respectively, suggesting its potential in applications such as magnetoencephalography in biomagnetism which have critical requirements on field sensitivity of the high-T-c SQUID especially at low frequencies.","Preparation of high-quality factor dielectric resonators for low-noise YBa2Cu3O7-?? radio frequency superconducting quantum interference devices","ELSEVIER","Li and  YL; Xu and  TQ; Wang and  HZ; Linghu and  KH; Huang and  ZG; Nie and  RJ; Wang and  Y; Wang and  FR; Gan and  ZZ","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:38:33,,,,

The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an individual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semiempirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a (bio)molecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of druglike molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the three-dimensional conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP).

However, the stabilizer 3-mercaptopropionic acid, commonly used in the synthesis of NIR-emitting QDs, is notorious for its toxicity and awful odor. Here we chose thiol ligand N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) its the ideal stabilizer and have successfully employed it to synthesize high-quality NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs in a one-step process via a simple hydrothermal route. NAC possesses favorable properties such as nontoxic, nonvolatile, inexpensive, and good water-solubility. Our as-prepared NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (45-62%), narrow full-width at half-maximum, and high photostability, thanks to the formation of a protective CdS shell on the CdTe core through the decomposition of NAC in the hydrothermal route under high temperature. The prepared QDs can be applied for bioimaging due to its excellent water-solubility and biological compatibility. The core/shell structure of the NIR-emitting CdTe/CdS QDs was verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and X-ray powder diffraction.

Here, we propose a scraping coating method for the fabrication of high-quality halide perovskite quantum dot (QD) film on electrode, which shows dense and uniform packing with minimum grain size. When CsPbBr3 QDs are taken as model materials, highly efficient ECL can be obtained from such perovskite QD film with anhydrous ethyl acetate as both electrolyte and coreactant. The CsPbBr3 QD film displays intense and stable ECL with ultranarrow emission spectrum bandwidth (24 nm). The CsPbBr3 QD film shows an extremely high ECL efficiency which is up to 5 times relative to the standard Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) /tri-n-propylamine system.

In this work, we report on the enhancement of EQE and the quality of ZnO NR-based hetrojunction white LEDs fabricated on a p-GaN substrate using a low temperature solution method. Cathodoluminescence spectra demonstrate that ultraviolet (UV) emission decreases and visible deep band emission increases with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs. The UV emission could be internally reabsorbed by the ZnO NR excitation, thus enhancing the emission intensity of the visible deep band. Photocurrent measurements validated the fact that the EQE depends on the size of ZnO NRs, increasing by 87% with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs. Furthermore, the quality of white light was measured and clearly indicated an increase in the color rendering indices of the LEDs with an increase in the length of the ZnO NRs, confirming that the quality of light generated by LEDs can be tuned by varying the length of the ZnO NRs. These results suggest that the EQE and visible deep band emission from n-ZnONRs/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs can be effectively controlled by adjusting the length of the ZnO NRs, which can be useful for realizing tunable white LEDs.","Enhancement of external quantum efficiency and quality of heterojunction white LEDs by varying the size of ZnO nanorods","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","Bano and  N; Hussain and  I; Sawaf and  S; Alshammari and  A; Saleemi and  F","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:40:41,,,,

Due to very low efficiency of the spontaneous emission resulting from the intersubband transitions in QC structures, it is still challenging to achieve milliwatts superluminescence under quasi-continuous wave condition at room temperature. In this work, we have developed a compact design of similar to 5 mu m SLEs which combines an inclined ridge waveguide with a J shaped waveguide, with a cavity suppression section introduced at the rear end and a straight part at the front end. This design enables the fabrication of longer devices without using greater chip area, and the fabricated SLEs exhibit a large output power of 2.2 mW and a low coherence length of about 40 mu m. Moreover, the characteristic temperature T-0 of 207 K reveals excellent temperature stability of the devices, and the far-field emission at the angle of 0 degrees exhibits a single transverse mode without any side lobes, which indicates a high optical quality of the emission beam. These results will facilitate the system integration of SLEs with other semiconductor devices and move a step forward to practical applications of mid-infrared systems.","High Power Compact Quantum Cascade Superluminescent Emitters with High Temperature Stability and Optical Beam Quality","AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS","Hou and  CC; Sun and  JL; Ning and  JQ; Zhang and  JC; Zhuo and  N; Chen and  HM; Liu and  QL; Zhao and  ZY; Wang and  ZG; Zhang and  ZY; Liu and  FQ","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:42:03,,,,

Their quality can be hampered by spectral, temporal, or spatial distinguishability of the two photons of a generated pair. Even when such defects have been corrected, the ultimate quality of the SPDC source is limited by the intrinsic multiple pair generation. In this paper, the effect of transmission, filtering and detection losses and asymmetrical spectral bandwidths in the photon pair paths on the visibility of the two-photon interference delivered by the SPDC source and its useful pair rate are investigated. In this investigation, two subcases are distinguished: deterministic and statistical splittings of the generated pairs, whatever the coherence of the multiple pairs. We show that the visibility is strongly degraded by a spectral bandwidth asymmetry, while the losses mainly affect the measured coincidence probability. The deterministic splitting configuration is shown to be generally more advantageous, although statistical splitting may present some advantages in applications with a narrow bandwidth requirement, such as those involving quantum memories. Moreover, while pump-induced optical noise only produces small visibility reductions, dark counts of the single-photon detectors are shown to limit the maximum possible visibility, particularly in the case of high-loss photon pair sources. Because our model quantifies the intrinsic limitations due to double pair emission in a simple way, the results presented can be used to optimize the design of SPDC sources and choose the optimum trade-offs between several key parameters such as visibility, generation probabilities, and spectral bandwidth, in particular for small bandwidth SPDC sources in the perspective of quantum networking and computing applications.

40690836,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,"entangled quantum microwave; von Neumann entropy; squeezed parameter; photon number","The entangled state of continuous variables of microwave frequency is an important resource in the field of quantum. In order to apply it to quantum communication protocol and quantum radar, the entanglement between two spatially separated subsystems, namely dual-path entangled quantum microwave is needed. However, for the circuit that generates the entangled quantum microwave, there is no suitable method to indicate whether the quality of the entangled microwave signal is good or not. Aiming at this problem, we put forward a method of evaluating the quality of dual-path entangled quantum microwave signals generated based on von Neumann entropy. The origin of the entangled quantum microwave is that vacuum state signals are transformed into squeezed state signals in driven pump, so in this paper we use a two-mode squeezed vacuum state to describe the formation of dual-path entangled quantum microwave signal, thus providing the function relation between the photon number and the squeezed parameter. In a communication system, the signal-noise ratio is usually used to express the reliability of system. Entropy is a measure of disorder degree in information. If both of them can be made the analogy, the entropy is used to evaluate the proportion of entangled state signals, the quality of original signals will be evaluated and the relationship among the entropy and squeezed parameter and the photon number will be analyzed. The simulation results show that the photon number in the entangled quantum microwave signal is determined by the squeezed parameter, and there is an index change with the square rule between them. Entropy decreases with the increase of squeezed parameter: its minimum value is 0, and its maximum value can be found from 0.9 to 1. The slope of curve is steep near the maximum, which reflects that the influence of squeezed parameter on the degree of entanglement is obvious, and that the range of optimal value choices in squeezed parameter is very narrow. The optimal value of squeezed parameter is dependent on photon number; it increases with the increase of the photon number. Entropy tends to decrease smoothly with the increase of squeezed parameter and it approximately has a negative exponent relation. The photon number in an actual signal is limited, so the limit value of entropy is estimated to be about 65%. The research shows that the quality of the entangled microwave signal can be improved by choosing appropriate squeezed parameter in different circuits that generate dual-path entangled quantum microwave signals for meeting the actual needs. Therefore, the research can provide the method of choosing the parameters of dual-path entangled quantum microwave circuit and improve the availability of system.","A method of evaluating the quality of dual-path entangled quantum microwave signal generated based on von Neumann entropy","CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC","Li and  X; Wu and  DW; Wang and  X; Miao and  Q; Chen and  K; Yang and  CY","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:42:27,,,,

High-performance emissivity of InP QDs has been achievable mostly from the use of an extremely hazardous, reactive P reagent of silylphosphine, thus demanding a search for safer, moderately reactive P precursors such as aminophosphine. Photoluminescence (PL) performances of aminophosphine-derived InP QDs become comparable to those of state-of-the-art silylphosphine-based ones particularly in green color, but this is not true for red color.

As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

CuInS2/ZnS quantum dot (QD) films were used to down-convert ultraviolet/blue photons to red emissions centered at 600 and 660 nm, resulting in increased biomass accumulation in red romaine lettuce. All plant growth parameters, except for spectral quality, were uniform across three production environments. Lettuce grown under the 600 and 660 nm-emitting QD films respectively increased edible dry mass (13 and 9%), edible fresh mass (11% each), and total leaf area (8 and 13%) compared with under a control film containing no QDs. Spectral modifications by the luminescent QD films improved photosynthetic efficiency in lettuce and could enhance productivity in greenhouses on Earth, or in space where, further conversion is expected from greater availability of ultraviolet photons.","Optimizing spectral quality with quantum dots to enhance crop yield in controlled environments","NATURE RESEARCH","Parrish and  CH; Hebert and  D; Jackson and  A; Ramasamy and  K; McDaniel and  H; Giacomelli and  GA; Bergren and  MR","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:45:15,,,,

Pharmaceutical quality concerns both the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and the Finished Drug Product/ Formulation. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of reports of harmful impurities in marketed drug formulations. Impurities range from solvents, reactants, adulterants, and catalysts to synthetic byproducts. Quality concerns in commercial preparations may also arise due to shelf life stability. Furthermore, a number of falsified and substandard drug cases have been reported. Most of the techniques which are currently in place can, at best, detect the impurities, but cannot identify them unless they are already known and can be compared to a standard. On the other hand, H-1 NMR spectroscopy detects all the hydrogen containing species, typically provides information to elucidate structures partially or even completely, and through its absolute quantitative capabilities even can detect the presence hydrogen-free species indirectly. The structural properties that produce H-1 NMR signals as characteristic representations of a given molecule are the chemical shifts (delta in ppm) and coupling constants (J in Hz). Along with the line widths (omega(1/2) in Hz), these parameters are bound to both the molecule and the NMR experimental conditions by quantum mechanical (QM) principles. This means that the H-1 NMR spectra of APIs can be precisely calculated and compared to the experimental data. This review explains how H-1 NMR spectroscopy coupled with Full Spin Analysis can contribute towards the quality control of pharmaceuticals by improving structural dereplication and achieving simultaneous quantification of both APIs and their contaminants.

The traditional beam propagation method is widely used to simulate the beam profile of the passive waveguide. In order to study the active device, however, the current induced variation in the active region should also be considered in the numerical simulation model. In the model presented in this paper, the phase and the amplitude of the propagating confined field in the active waveguide are determined by a few linear and non-linear effects. The parameters relating to the linear effects, such as the intrinsic refractive index profile and the intrinsic losses of the waveguide under zero current injection, are calculated by using COMSOL-Multiphysics. While the non-linear effects, such as the modal gain and the refractive index variation induced by current injection, are considered in a rigorous way by including the rate-equation set for calculating the carrier dynamics in the active region. The parameters used in the rate-equation set are obtained by referring to the literature and fitting the experimental results of the considered terahertz lasers. By adding the current induced gain and refractive index variation, the presented beam propagation model is able to simulate many current-dependant properties of a laser, such as the output power, the gain guiding effect, and the self-focusing effect. We show in this paper that the latter two effects have influence on inner-waveguide beam profile, and the competitive balance between them determines the output beam quality. By utilizing this numerical model, the terahertz quantum cascade laser with tapered waveguide structure is simulated, and the influences of the taper angle on output power and beam quality are investigated. According to the simulation results, we find that there is an obvious increase in the output power when the taper angle is increased from 0 to 3 degree, while the increment in the output power decreases rapidly when the taper angle is further increased. Besides, we observe that for the far field the full width at half maximum of the output beam decreases sharply with increasing the taper angle. However, when the taper angle equals 8 degree, multiple lateral modes are observed, which indicates poor output beam quality of this device and poor beam coupling efficiency between this device and the power meter. Therefore, although the simulation results show that the output power of this device is higher than that of the device with 5 degree taper angle, the experiment results show that the measured output power is lower. So the taper angle is not the larger the better, but there exists an optimum value, at which the terahertz quantum cascade laser can achieve the highest effective output power.","Analyses of the output power and beam quality of the tapered terahertz quantum cascade lasers","CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC","Xu and  TH; Yao and  C; Wan and  WJ; Zhu and  YH; Cao and  JC","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:47:01,,,,

The film was then etched into narrow wires, which were parallel to the direction of nickel propagation. The NILC second anneal at 900 degreesC was then performed on these silicon wire. Through surface energy anisotropy stimulated grain expansion in the NILC high-temperature second annealing, enhanced grain quality beyond that oil planar polysilicon film. Transistor fabricated on these wire is similar to gate-all-around structure as that of FinFET [2]. Much better scalability to the deep submicron region was observed for these wire transistors than regular planar TFTs formed on the same NILC film.

The total PL efficiency is the product of these two factors, for which the optimal annealing temperatures are found to be similar to 700 degrees C and similar to 760 degrees C, respectively, whereas the optimal annealing temperature for the integrated PL intensity is found to be between the two temperatures and equals similar to 720 degrees C. We connect the variation of the carrier collection efficiency with the modification of the band bending conditions in the investigated structure due to the Fermi level shift in the GaInNAsSb layer after annealing.","Enhancement of photoluminescence from GaInNAsSb quantum wells upon annealing: improvement of material quality and carrier collection by the quantum well","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","Baranowski and  M; Kudrawiec and  R; Latkowska and  M; Syperek and  M; Misiewicz and  J; Sarmiento and  T; Harris and  JS","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:47:23,,,,

Two sets of GaN samples were grown on c-plane sapphire substrates, one included a buffer containing a few AlN and GaN layers grown at different temperatures and another set contained a buffer layer into which additional QD structures were inserted. As compared to samples without QDs, samples with QDs generally showed narrower X-ray diffraction peaks and higher photoluminescence efficiency. The density of dislocations was examined by pit revealing wet chemical etching and AFM imaging. It was found that insertion of multiple GaN/AlN QD layers into the buffer layer effectively reduces the density of dislocations in the epitaxial layers. Compared to dislocation densities similar to10(10)cm(-2) typically observed in GaN films grown on AlN buffer layers, a density of similar to5x 10(7) cm(-2) was demonstrated in the GaN films grown on GaN/AlN multiple QD layers.","Improvement in crystal quality of GaN films with quantum dots as buffer layers grown on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","Huang and  C; Litton and  CW; Reshchikov and  MA; Yun and  F; King and  T; Baski and  AA; Morko?? and  H","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:47:33,,,,

Strengthening the substrate metabolism for producing more reducing power was found to stimulate the production of several reduced thiol-containing proteins (including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin) that play key roles in Bio-QDs assembly.

Investigated structures have application relevance due to emission in the 3rd telecommunication window. The nanostructures are grown by ripening-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. This leads to their unique properties, i.e., low spatial density and in-plane shape symmetry. These are advantageous for non-classical light generation for quantum technologies applications. As a measure of the internal quantum efficiency, the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined photon extraction efficiency is used. The investigated nanostructures exhibit close to ideal emission efficiency proving their high structural quality. The thermal stability of emission is investigated by means of microphotoluminescence. This allows to determine the maximal operation temperature of the device and reveal the main emission quenching channels. Emission quenching is predominantly caused by the transition of holes and electrons to higher QD's levels. Additionally, these carriers could further leave the confinement potential via the dense ladder of QD states. Single QD emission is observed up to temperatures of about 100 K, comparable to the best results obtained for epitaxial QDs in this spectral range. The fundamental limit for the emission rate is the excitation radiative lifetime, which spreads from below 0.5 to almost 1.9 ns (GHz operation) without any clear spectral dispersion.

To overcome this challenge, we are focusing on exploiting quantum crowdsourcing schemes in which the welfare of requestor or worker can be maximized since quantum players share the extended strategy space, and the introduction of entanglement offers a new method of depicting fine-grained relations between players. Specifically, we propose a quantum game model for quota-oriented crowdsourcing game to address dilemmas in task allocation. The result indicates the dilemma based on classical strategy will disappear with the increment of entanglement degree. While in the quality-oriented crowdsourcing game, we adopt a density matrix approach to calculate the optimal payoffs of both sides, which demonstrates the superiority of our quantum strategy. Moreover, our quantum scheme is generic since it is compatible with the schemes from a classical perspective.

Furthermore, we show that the size of a QUBO instance (i.e., the dimension of the QUBO matrix) is not a sufficient predictor for solution quality, as larger QUBO instances may produce better results than smaller QUBO instances for the same problem. We also empirically show that the number of different quadratic values of a QUBO instance, combined with their range, can significantly impact the solution quality.","Influence of Different 3SAT-to-QUBO Transformations on the Solution Quality of Quantum Annealing: A Benchmark Study","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","Zielinski and  S; N??sslein and  J; Stein and  J; Gabor and  T; Linnhoff-Popien and  C; Feld and  S","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:49:10,,,,

In this contribution to the focus collection 'What would you do with 1000 qubits?', we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable.

Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model.

The extensive use of microwave heating and the frequently suggested specific microwave effects, however, pose questions about the role of the electromagnetic field in both the formation and quality of the produced QDs. In this work a one-pot protocol for the tunable synthesis of monodisperse colloidal CdSe NCs using microwave dielectric heating under carefully controlled conditions is introduced. CdSe QDs are fabricated using selenium dioxide as a selenium precursor, 1-octadecene as a solvent and reducing agent, cadmium alkyl carboxylates or alkyl phosphonates as cadmium sources, 1,2-hexadecanediol to stabilize the cadmium complex and oleic acid to stabilize the resulting CdSe QDs. Utilizing the possibilities of microwave heating technology in combination with accurate online temperature control the influence of different reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, ramp and hold times, and the timing and duration of oleic acid addition have been carefully investigated. Optimum results were obtained by performing the reaction at 240 degrees C applying a 5 min ramp time, 2 min hold time before oleic acid addition, 90 s for oleic acid addition, and a 5 min hold time after oleic acid addition (8.5 min overall holding at 240 degrees C). By using different cadmium complexes in the microwave protocol CdSe QDs with a narrow size distribution can be obtained in different sizes ranging from 0.5-4 nm by simply changing the cadmium source. The QDs were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, UV-Vis, and photoluminescence methods and the size distribution was monitored by SAXS. Control experiments involving conventional conductive heating under otherwise identical conditions ensuring the same heating and cooling profiles, stirring rates, and reactor geometries demonstrate that the electromagnetic field has no influence on the generated CdSe QDs. The resulting CdSe NCs prepared using either conductive or microwave dielectric heating exhibited the same primary crystallite size, shape, quantum yield and size distribution regardless of the heating mode.","Microwave-assisted synthesis of CdSe quantum dots: can the electromagnetic field influence the formation and quality of the resulting nanocrystals?","ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY","Moghaddam and  MM; Baghbanzadeh and  M; Keilbach and  A; Kappe and  CO","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:51:02,,,,

Therefore we set up measurement procedures for the quantities intensity transfer function (ITF) (also called characteristic curve), modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS) and the low frequency drop (LFD). The quantities ITF, MTF, NPS and LFD are determined by the analysis of images of simple, standardized test objects (a slit, Al-filters of different thickness and a lead disk). The images are automatically evaluated by means of an Apple Macintosh workstation and the program NIH image with some special extensions. The resulting quantities MTF, NPS, LFD are combined to determine the noise equivalent quanta (NEQ) and the detective quantum efficiency (DQE). By means of this measurement procedure quantities, that describe the objective image quality like NEQ and DQE, can be determined in a simple way. Only a set of 45 images is needed for diagnosis of a system. This method provides a powerful analysis tool for image quality, that is applicable in the field and can be done from a remote location. It may be used in a clinical environment (e.g. in constancy testing).","Assessment of objective image quality in digital radiography: noninvasive determination of the detective quantum efficiency","Scopus: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt EngConference paperFinal","Kamm and  Karl-Friedrich (7005086758); Steiner and  Reinhard (57197492543); Tilkorn and  Karl (6503870723)","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:51:08,,,,

We have employed both InAlP ternary alloy cladding layers and specially designed InAlP-InGaP superlattice barrier (SLB) cladding layers. The 4.2 K and 300 K photoluminescence (PL) emission from both the InGaP QW and the InAlP/InGaP SLB heterostructures exhibits very narrow line widths and high intensities, indicating that these structures have relatively smooth interfaces and that they are of high quality. While studies of InAlGaP injection lasers using similar SLBs have been published previously, to our knowledge, detailed photoluminescence studies of ternary/ternary SLBs in the InAlGaP system have not been reported. We have performed calculations of the performance of InAlP/InGaP ternary SLBs and these calculations show that an optimum QW heterobarrier can be achieved for an all-ternary SLB consisting of 10 pairs of InAlP (similar to 1.7 nm) and InGaP (similar to 0.9 nm) and an InAlP ''first barrier layer'' similar to 20 nm thick.

Optimized growth conditions with high V/III, low gas speed, and slow growth rates resulted in improved crystal quality, PL emission efficiency, and micron-scale wavelength uniformity. One of the main challenges in green MQWs with high Indium content is the formation of Indium inclusion type defects due to the large lattice mismatch combined with the miscibility gap between GaN and InN. An effective way of eliminating Indium inclusions was demonstrated by introducing a small fraction of H-2 (2.7%) in the gas composition during the growth of high temperature GaN quantum barriers.

In the first time, we proposed system with a single barrier CdMnTe is embedded between two semi-infinite substrates. Hence, the corresponding Eigen modes energies were found to be shifted towards lower energies as the barrier thickness increases. The resulting Eigen modes are characterized by a high transmission rates but a very low quality factor values, which highlight the importance of the system periodicity. On the other hand, in order to create localized states in the band gaps, a defective system is exanimated. Indeed, a defect barrier is inserted in a perfect multi-quantum wells (MQWs) system, basically made of repeated CdMnTe barriers and CdTe wells. This defective system can create multi defect modes in the electronic band gaps. The analysis of the transmittance spectra of the defect states evidences a shift to lower energies by increasing the defect thickness with fixed parameters of the system. These defect states move toward higher energy regions, when the concentration of defect increases. In addition, the energy of the defect states varying from 600 meV to 785 meV. We found one defect state for a defect concentration equal to 0.7, when the defect thickness is equal to 5 A degrees. Otherwise, for a defect concentration equal to 0.1, with a defect thickness of 150 A degrees, we found two defect states appeared inside the gaps. While, three defect states were found for a concentration interval between 0.3 and 0.5 and a defect thickness equal respectively to 127 A degrees and 145 A degrees. These defect states have higher quality factors reaching 7630000. Moreover, it shown that the number of gaps modes depends on the defect concentration's and thickness' parameters.

By comparing the evolutionwith the temperature of the dephasing and the spin-relaxation rate, we conclude that both processes are related to the rate of excitonic collisions. When spin relaxation occurs in the motional-narrowing regime, it remains constant over a large temperature range as the spin-precession frequency increases linearly with temperature, hence compensating for the observed decrease in the dephasing time. From those measurements, a value of the electron-hole exchange interaction strength of 0.45 meV at T = 10K is inferred.","Determining the nature of excitonic dephasing in high-quality GaN/AlGaN quantum wells through time-resolved and spectrally resolved four-wave mixing spectroscopy","AMER PHYSICAL SOC","Gallart and  M; Ziegler and  M; Cr??gut and  O; Feltin and  E; Carlin and  JF; Butt?? and  R; Grandjean and  N; H??nerlage and  B; Gilliot and  P","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:51:45,,,,

This is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement, this quantity is straightforward to calculate, and we find it to be precisely equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al. It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum reference frame.

In comparison, at the same growth temperature, GaInAs heterostructures appear more homogeneous. It is proposed therefore that the introduction of N in the structure could be responsible for the enhanced phase separation. A broadening of the photoluminescence peak in GaInNAs structures when raising the growth temperature has also been found associated with the increase in composition fluctuations. Moreover, a kinetically limited Stranski-Krastanow growth mode has been observed in both GaInAs and GaInNAs structures, taking place at lower temperature in GaInNAs quantum wells.

Close parallels exist between VQMC and the emerging hybrid quantum-classical computational paradigm of variational quantum algorithms. VQMC overcomes the curse of dimensionality by performing alternating steps of Monte Carlo sampling from a parametrized quantum state followed by gradient-based optimization. While VQMC has been applied to solve high-dimensional problems, it is known to be difficult to parallelize, primarily owing to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step. In this work, we explore the scalability of VQMC when autoregressive models, with exact sampling, are used in place of MCMC. This approach can exploit distributed-memory, shared-memory and/or GPU parallelism in the sampling task without any bottlenecks.

The LEDs exhibited a low turn-on voltage of similar to 2 V without efficiency droop up to injection current of 500 mA (1.6 kA/cm(2)) at similar to 5 V.

QD properties were studied by reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. All structures were prepared by low pressure metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. Concerning the lower interface, a good epitaxial surface planarity is required for QD formation with high QD density and narrow size distribution. Therefore the growth conditions of the QD buffer layer are very important. We demonstrate the improvement of the QD size distribution and homogeneity, when the growth rate of the buffer layer was decreased. The upper QD interface is formed during the covering process. InAs quantum dots were capped by GaAs or by GaAsSb. The presence of Sb atoms in covering layer strongly influences the interface abruptness. In the case of GaAs covering layer, an InGaAs layer with gradual decrease of In concentration is unintentionally formed at the interface between InAs and GaAs. The presence of Sb in GaAsSb covering layer helps to form abrupt interface between InAs and covering layer. However, enhanced surfacting of In atoms was observed for GaAsSb SRL. An optimal GaAsSb composition profile is suggested to prevent dissolution of QDs during the covering process and to minimize the amount of surfacting In atoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore growth of InP after growing InGaAs is likely to have a transition layer of InGaAsP/InAsP of uncontrolled composition even though the arsine flow is switched off, because of trace amounts of arsine in the growth reactor. A common technique used to minimise the problem is to introduce a suitable pause in the growth sequence during the transition from InGaAs layer to InP layer in order to minimise the arsine content in the growth chamber, before starting the growth of InP. We find from photoluminescence (PL) measurements that this pause is not sufficient to optimise the well quality. The halfwidth of PL can be improved further by growing an intermediate layer of InGaAsP between InGaAs and InP, such that the quantum well structure consists of 5 layers in the sequence: InP/InGaAsP/InGaAs/InGaAsP/InP. The optimisation of pause sequence is made during the switching steps: (i) pause P1- in the transition from InGaAsP to InGaAs and (ii) pause P2- in the transition from InGaAs to InGaAsP.

The increase of CdSe/ZnS QDs size from 9.1 to 11.7 nm results in a decrease in CdSe/ZnS QDs loading amount and an increase in QYs of incorporated CdSe/ZnS QDs. This tradeoff leads to an optimized CdSe/ZnS QDs size of 10.5 nm, which exhibits the best LFIA performance due to the balanced QDs loading (2.26 g g(-1)) and QY (57.1%).

Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures- whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) lasers by drop-casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1-xZnxS core/buffer-shell@graded-shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented.

The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric- and magnetic-mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs-WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric-field distribution inside the microcavity.

The resultant nanowires (NWs), with a diameter of 200-250 nm, have an average length of 2 mu m. The feasibility of growing high-quality NWs with well-controlled indium composition MQW structure is demonstrated. These resultant NWs grown on Si(111) substrates were utilized for fabricating vertical-type light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The steep and intense photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra are observed, based on the strain-free NWs on Si(111) substrates. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis revealed that the MQW NWs are grown along the c-plane with uniform thickness. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of these NWs exhibited typical p-n junction LEDs and showed a sharp onset voltage at 2.75 V in the forward bias.

We show that j(0)(opt)(N) scales as N-1/6 for large N and that it ensures a high-quality entanglement transfer even in the limit of arbitrarily long channels, almost independently of the channel initialization. For instance, for any chain length the average quantum-state transmission fidelity exceeds 90% and decreases very little in a broad neighbourhood of j(0)(opt)(N).

Three distinct dissociation processes are observed for the well-resolved hole cyclotron replicas (shake-up) of positive trions bound to neutral acceptors in the spin-doublet state (SU-A(0)X(d)(+)). To demonstrate that the hole involved in the shake-up process is not bound by the Coulomb interaction to the charged A(0)X(+) complex, we calculate the valence Landau levels using the Luttinger model beyond the axial approximation. The calculated value of the hole cyclotron energy agrees well with the experimental data for the energy separation of the A(0)X(+) and SU-A(0)X(+) lines, determined from the emission spectra. At low temperatures, below 6 K, the dominant dissociation results in a free hole and an exciton bound to the neutral acceptor in the spin-singlet or -triplet state, (A(0)X(d)(+) -> A(0)X(s) + h or A(0)X(t) + h). At higher temperatures, above 9 K, the dissociation into the free positive trion and the neutral acceptor (A(0)X(d)(+) -> A(0) + X+) predominates.

Here, we report evidence for an even-denominator FQHS at nu = 1/4 in ultra-high-quality two-dimensional hole systems confined to modulation-doped GaAs quantum wells. We observe a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance at nu = 1/4, superimposed on a highly insulating background, suggesting a close competition between the nu = 1/4 FQHS and the magnetic-field-induced, pinned Wigner solid states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the very recent theoretical calculations that predict that substantial Landau level mixing, caused by the large hole effective mass, can induce composite fermion pairing and lead to a non-Abelian FQHS at nu = 1/4. Our results demonstrate that Landau level mixing can provide a very potent means for tuning the interaction between composite fermions and creating new nonAbelian FQHSs.","Fractional Quantum Hall State at Filling Factor ??=1/4 in Ultra-High-Quality GaAs Two-Dimensional Hole Systems","AMER PHYSICAL SOC","Wang and  CY; Gupta and  A; Singh and  SK; Madathil and  PT; Chung and  YJ; Pfeiffer and  LN; Baldwin and  KW; Winkler and  R; Shayegan and  M","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:56:42,,,,

This procedure involves the parametrization of force fields to reproduce ab initio forces obtained from condensed phase quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. During the procedure, the MM part of the QM/MM is iteratively improved so as to approach ab initio quality. In this work, the AFM method has been tested to parametrize force fields for liquid water so that the resulting force fields reproduce forces calculated using the ab initio MP2 and the Kohn-Sham density functional theory with the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) and Becke three-parameter LYP (B3LYP) exchange correlation functionals. The AFM force fields generated in this work are very simple to evaluate and are supported by most molecular dynamics (MD) codes. At the same time, the quality of the forces predicted by the AFM force fields rivals that of very expensive ab initio calculations and are found to successfully reproduce many experimental properties. The site-site radial distribution functions (RDFs) obtained from MD simulations using the force field generated from the BLYP functional through AFM compare favorably with the previously published RDFs from Car-Parrinello MD simulations with the same functional. Technical aspects of AFM such as the optimal QM cluster size, optimal basis set, and optimal QM method to be used with the AFM procedure are discussed in this paper.

This approach combines the versatility of colloidal semiconducting nanoparticles (bright emission, solubility, and high stability) with the spatial precision of optical lithography to create robust large-area optical lasing arrays (up to a few thousand disks). Specifically, microdisk lasers with high quality factors (within 1000-2000) are fabricated with predefined size and shape (as controlled by master templates) with high consistency and throughput, essentially providing a new approach to fabricate difficult-to-control on-chip optical cavities in a low-cost and effective manner. Notably, the number of longitudinal cavity modes in the microdisk laser can be precisely controlled by varying the microdisks' diameter, allowing for either near-single mode or multimode operation while preserving high quality factors. Furthermore, the cross-linking of quantum dots imparts high chemical resistance and mechanical robustness that helps retain the structural integrity under harsh processing conditions (such as sonication or direct exposure to various solvents). As such, these quantum dot microdisk laser arrays are promising candidates for advancing the development of large-area, low-cost on-chip photonic structures with controlled lasing modes.","Large-Scale Robust Quantum Dot Microdisk Lasers with Controlled High Quality Cavity Modes","WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH","Lin and  CH; Zeng and  QJ; Lafalce and  E; Smith and  MJ; Malak and  ST; Jung and  JH; Yoon and  YJ; Lin and  ZQ; Vardeny and  ZV; Tsukruk and  VV","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 20:58:39,,,,

The second group of plants was grown at 25 degrees C-RZT for 10 days before transferring to 38 degrees C-RZT for 10 days and then to 42 degrees C-RZT for another 16 days (primed). For the third group, plants were grown at 25 degrees C-RZT for 20 days and for the last 16 days were transferred to 42 degrees C-RZT (non-primed). RZ heat priming did not affect the leaf expansion of Arugula while the leaf expansion was slower in RZ heat primed Canasta compared to 25 degrees C-RZT plants. After transferring to 42 degrees C-RZT in the later stage, RZ heat primed Arugula had similar productivity but a larger root system with higher nutritional quality at harvest and during postharvest storage compared to those of 25 degrees C-RZT plants. After subjection to 42 degrees C-RZT, although RZ heat priming enhanced its nutritional quality, the productivity of Canasta was compromised. The results of this study suggest that it is feasible to enhance productivity and nutritional quality of leafy greens at lower production cost through RZT management.","Root-Zone Heat Priming Effects on Maximum Quantum Efficiency of PSII, Productivity, Root Morphology and Nutritional Quality of Two Aeroponically Grown Leafy Greens in a Tropical Greenhouse","MDPI","He and  J; Tan and  C; Qin and  L","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:19:00,,,,

We report here measurements on an ultralow-disorder, dilute 2DES, confined to a GaAs quantum well. In the nu < 1=5 range, superimposed on a highly insulating longitudinal resistance, the 2DES exhibits a developing fractional quantum Hall state at nu =1/7, attesting to its exceptional high quality and dominance of electron-electron interaction in the low filling regime. In the nearby insulating phases, we observe remarkable nonlinear I-V and noise characteristics as a function of increasing current, with current thresholds delineating three distinct phases of the WS: a pinned phase (P1) with very small noise, a second phase (P2) in which dV/dI fluctuates between positive and negative values and is accompanied by very high noise, and a third phase (P3) where dV/dI is nearly constant and small, and noise is about an order of magnitude lower than in P2. In the depinned (P2 and P3) phases, the noise spectrum also reveals well-defined peaks at frequencies that vary linearly with the applied current, suggestive of washboard frequencies.

Regarding the p-GaN shell above the c-plane MQS region, only a few screw dislocations and Frank-type partial dislocations appeared at the interface between the serpentine c-plane MQS and the p-GaN shell near the tips. This suggested that the crystalline quality of the MQS structure can trigger the formation of screw dislocations and Frank-type partial dislocations during the p-GaN growth. The growth mechanism of the p-GaN shell on NWs was also discussed. To inspect the electronic properties, a prototype of a micro light-emitting diode (LED) with a chip size of 50 X 50 mu m(2) was demonstrated in the NWs with optimal growth. By correlating the light output curve with the electroluminescence spectra, three different emission peaks (450, 470, and 510 nm) were assignable to the emission from the m-, r-, and c-planes, respectively.","Morphology Control and Crystalline Quality of p-Type GaN Shells Grown on Coaxial GaInN/GaN Multiple Quantum Shell Nanowires","AMER CHEMICAL SOC","Lu and  WF; Nakayama and  N; Ito and  K; Katsuro and  S; Sone and  N; Miyamoto and  Y; Okuno and  K; Iwaya and  M; Takeuchi and  T; Kamiyama and  S; Akasaki and  I","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:22:14,,,,
40691027,http://dx.doi.org/10,0,"Power quality; Comprehensive assessment; Quantum clustering; Pattern recognition","Steady-state power quality (PQ) indices seldom exceed the limits in power systems. Therefore, steady-state PQ monitoring data show a distinct imbalanced structure (i.e. unequal distribution). To ensure the efficient assessment of PQ performance, new and more appropriate tools for analyzing these data are needed. In this paper, an analysis method based on Quantum clustering is proposed, aiming to address the imbalanced structure of monitoring data. Firstly, the imbalanced structure of PQ monitoring data is analyzed. Secondly, Quantum clustering is performed on the PQ monitoring data and several disparate patterns of clusters are recognized. Thirdly, cluster severity index of cluster and the region severity index of region are defined to quantify the PQ performance of a cluster and a region, respectively. The cluster severity index is defined according to the sum of the proportions between cluster centers and limit for the respective PQ index. The region severity index is defined according to the proportions of PQ monitoring data of each region belonging to the different clusters with the corresponding cluster severity index. By sorting the region severity index in descending order, regions with poorer PQ performance become a higher-ranking place, which enables an easy comparison among regions. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the PQ monitoring data of 11 regions in a large city in China. The method can effectively distill diverse abnormal patterns from substantially imbalanced monitoring data, which is beneficial for easy and automatic detection of regions having issues with PQ indices exceeding defined limits.","Analysis of large-scale power quality monitoring data based on quantum clustering","ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA","Zhong and  Q; Liang and  JH; Xu and  Z; Meyer and  J; Wang and  LJ; Wang and  G","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:22:21,,,,

This paper presents a method to improve the power quality (PQ) and reliability of distribution systems by employing optimal NR. Optimal NR is applied independently to a system in a specified period to minimize the number of propagated voltage sags (N-sag) and other reliability indexes such as the average system interruption frequency index, sustained average interruption frequency index, and momentary average interruption frequency index. The quantum-inspired binary firefly algorithm (QBFA) is used to find the optimal NR. The QBFA performance for the application of optimal NR to minimize N-sag is first compared with other established optimization methods such as the standard binary firefly algorithm and gravitational search algorithm. Case studies are conducted by using other objective functions, and reliability assessment is performed to observe the reliability improvement caused by the new network topology.

Optimized growth conditions with high V/III, low gas speed, and slow growth rates resulted in improved crystal quality, PL emission efficiency, and micron-scale wavelength uniformity.

However, existing methods for integrating CQW onto microresonators will cause low laser quality due to uneven CQW coating. To overcome this, the use of liquid-interface kinetically driven self-assembly is proposed to coat ultrathin, close-packed layers of colloidal CdSe/Cd1-xZnxS core/shell CQWs between 7 and 14 nm onto the surface of silica microsphere cavities.

For example, a warm white shade is desirable for indoors, corresponding to correlated color temperatures <= 4000 K, together with color rendering indices >= 90. Additionally, the luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) should be high, preferably >= 380 lm/W-opt. Conventional white LEDs cannot currently satisfy these requirements simultaneously.

The architecture of red, yellow and green emitting QD films (in this order from the chip outwards) is demonstrated to outperform the rest.

The energy of a given protein is expressed as the summation of atomic contributions from QM calculations of various subsystems, corrected by long-range Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. With the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) method, our protocol can automatically generate training sets with high efficiency. To facilitate the construction of training sets for proteins, we store all trained subsystem data in a library. If subsystems in the library are detected in a new protein, corresponding datasets can be directly reused as a part of the training set on this new protein.

Close parallels exist between VQMC and the emerging hybrid quantum-classical computational paradigm of variational quantum algorithms. VQMC overcomes the curse of dimensionality by performing alternating steps of Monte Carlo sampling from a parametrized quantum state followed by gradient-based optimization. While VQMC has been applied to solve high-dimensional problems, it is known to be difficult to parallelize, primarily owing to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step. In this work, we explore the scalability of VQMC when autoregressive models, with exact sampling, are used in place of MCMC. This approach can exploit distributed-memory, shared-memory and/or GPU parallelism in the sampling task without any bottlenecks. In particular, we demonstrate GPU-scalability of VQMC for solving up to ten-thousand dimensional combinatorial optimization problems.","Overcoming Barriers to Scalability in Variational Quantum Monte Carlo","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","Zhao and  TC; De and  S; Chen and  B; Stokes and  J; Veerapaneni and  S","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:27:24,,,,

Photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) can enhance abdominal image quality, especially in combination with a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm, quantum iterative reconstruction (QIR).The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of different QIR levels on PCD-CT imaging of HCC in both phantom and patient scans.MethodsVirtual monoenergetic images at 50 keV were reconstructed using filtered back projection and all available QIR levels (QIR 1-4). Objective image quality properties were investigated in phantom experiments. The study also included 44 patients with triple-phase liver PCD-CT scans of viable HCC lesions. Quantitative image analysis involved assessing the noise, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio of the lesions. Qualitative image analysis was performed by three raters evaluating noise, artifacts, lesion conspicuity, and overall image quality using a 5-point Likert scale.ResultsNoise power spectra in the phantom experiments showed increasing noise suppression with higher QIR levels without affecting the modulation transfer function. This pattern was confirmed in the in vivo scans, in which the lowest noise levels were found in QIR-4 reconstructions, with around a 50% reduction in median noise level compared with the filtered back projection images. As contrast does not change with QIR, QIR-4 also yielded the highest contrast-to-noise ratios. With increasing QIR levels, rater scores were significantly better for all qualitative image criteria (all p < .05).ConclusionsWithout compromising image sharpness, the best image quality of iodine contrast optimized low-keV virtual monoenergetic images can be achieved using the highest QIR level to suppress noise. Using these settings as standard reconstruction for HCC in PCD-CT imaging might improve diagnostic accuracy and confidence.","Quantum iterative reconstruction on a photon-counting detector CT improves the quality of hepatocellular carcinoma imaging","BMC","Graafen and  D; Stoehr and  F; Halfmann and  MC; Emrich and  T; Foerster and  F; Yang and  Y; D??ber and  C; M??ller and  L; Kloeckner and  R","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:29:54,,,,

With increasing surface offcut angle towards [1 $(1) over bar $0] direction, the interaction of spiral growth around threading dislocations (TDs) with the offcut-induced atomic steps leads to a gradual change in the morphology of the AlSb buffer from one dominated by hillocks to that exhibiting near-parallel steps, and finally to a surface with increasing number of localized depressions. With the growth conditions used, the smoothest AlSb surface morphology was obtained for the offcut angles range of 0.8-1.3 degrees. On substrates with 0 degrees offcut, subsequent 3 repeats of Al0.24In0.76Sb/Al0.12In0.88Sb interlayers reduces the TD density of AlSb buffer by a factor of 10, while 70 times reduction in the surface density of TD-related hillocks is observed.

In fact, high computational cost can be the most important obstacle in WPPO problems. Population-based metaheuristics algorithms (PBMAs) are the most widely utilized ones for WPPO problems. However, these methods suffer from the issue that at each iteration, the minimum number of simulation run is at least equal to the population size. Knowing this, in order to enhance the efficiency of these methods, in this study, we introduced a cell-based quality gate function (CBQGF) which is inspired from quantum gates in quantum computing. The CBQGF is incorporated in our previously introduced inter-distance algorithm (IDC) which we called CBQG-IDC. Since, CBQG sets a condition for each location during the optimization process, locations with poor cell properties will be filtered out to increase the rate of convergence considerably. We applied the CBQG-IDC to two universally popular global optimization methods, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and compared the results to the IDC limited algorithm. In all scenarios, net present value (NPV) was considered as the fitness value and all joint optimization of locations and well associated parameters were conducted simultaneously. The results showed CBQG-IDC with a much higher rate of convergence compared to IDC, while its performance is highly dependent on constant parameters. Ultimately, the proposed CBQG-IDC can be applied to any optimization algorithm for any placement optimization problem in Euclidian geometry to save the computational cost.","Joint optimization of constrained well placement and control parameters with a quantum-inspired cell-based quality gate function","ELSEVIER","Semnani and  A; Xu and  YG; Ostadhassan and  M","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:30:45,,,,

Herein, a facile new synthesis is developed for highly monodisperse and halide passivated PbS QDs. The new synthesis is based on a heterogeneous system containing a PbCl2-Pb(OA)(2) solid-liquid precursor solution. The solid PbCl2 inhibits the diffusion of monomers and maintains a high oversaturation condition for the growth of PbS QDs, resulting in high monodispersities. In addition, the PbCl2 gives rise to halide passivation on the PbS QDs, showing excellent stability in air. The high monodispersity and good passivation endow these PbS QDs with outstanding optoelectronic properties, demonstrated by a 9.43% power conversion efficiency of PbS QD solar cells with a bandgap of similar to 0.95 eV (1,300 nm).

The morphology effects of graphene seeds on the polygon growth behavior were explored by the random deposition of C-2 species on the Ni(111) surface. The results demonstrated that in the presence of the graphene seeds, hexagons can be formed directly at the seed edges, different from the pentagon-first mechanism proposed before. At the edge of the seeds, different growth behaviors were observed depending on the specific edge structure. We found that the edge structures which are consisted of more carbon atoms prefer to form more hexagons, giving rise to the higher quality of graphene. Compared with the seed C-16, C-24 has more zigzag edge structures and is expected to produce more hexagons. This has been confirmed by our simulation, where the seed C-24 produced higher quality graphene than C-16.

Their benefits include near-infrared(NIR) absorption onset, efficient NIR photoluminescence(PL), and low reabsorption losses stemming from the intragapcharacter of their emission. To streamline optimization ofCISeS QDs for LSC applications, we develop an analyticalmodel which allows us to relate the absorptance-optimizedexternal quantum efficiency (EQE) to the QD PL quantumyield (QY) and theeffective LSC quality factor,< Q >, used tocharacterize the interplay between the QD's light-harvestingability and self-induced reabsorption losses. Specifically, weshow that the peak EQE can be approximated by the product ofQY and log(< Q >), the conclusion validated by the numerical analysis of 47 QD samples. Interestingly, according to themodeling, the QDs with < Q >= 10.5 and QY = 78% were expected to yield the highest EQE in the surveyed group (11.8% forLSC dimensions 9.5x9.5x0.77 cm3). This prediction was confirmed by experimental measurements that indicated an EQEof 11.7% for this particular sample.

Its efficiency depends on the learning algorithm employed, thus deserving algorithmic comparisons for its practical applications. Here we assess three representative learning algorithms, including GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE), improved Nelder-Mead (NMplus), and Differential Evolution (DE), by searching for high-quality control pulses to prepare the Bell state. We first implement each algorithm experimentally in a nuclear magnetic resonance system and then conduct a numerical study considering the impact of some possible significant experimental uncertainties. The experiments report the successful preparation of the high-fidelity target state by the three algorithms, while NMplus converges fastest, and these results coincide with the numerical simulations when potential uncertainties are negligible. However, under certain significant uncertainties, these algorithms possess distinct performance with respect to their resulting precision and efficiency, and DE shows the best robustness.

High-quality PPG signals are necessary to extract cardiores-piratory information accurately. Motion artifacts can easily corrupt PPG signals due to human locomotion, leading to noise enriched, poor quality signals. Several rule-based and Machine-Learning (ML) - based approaches for PPG signal quality estimation are available, but those algorithms' efficacy is questionable. So, the authors propose a lightweight CNN architecture for signal quality assessment by employing a novel Quantum Pattern Recognition (QPR) technique. The proposed algorithm is validated on manually annotated data obtained from the University of Queensland database. A total of 28366, 5s signal segments are preprocessed and transformed into image files of 20 x 500 pixels for input to the 2D CNN architecture. The developed model classifies the PPG signal as 'good' and 'bad' with an accuracy of 98.3% with 99.3% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity and 98.9% F1-score. The experimental analysis concludes that slim module based architecture and novel Spatio-temporal pattern recognition technique improve the system's performance.

Purpose: To investigate the image quality and the optimal strength level of a quantum IR algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) for virtual monoenergetic images and polychromatic images (T3D) in a phantom and in patients undergoing portal venous abdominal PCD CT. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured in a water-filled phantom. Consecutive oncologic patients who underwent portal venous abdominal PCD CT between March and April 2021 were included. Virtual monoenergetic images at 60 keV and T3D were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off; reference standard) and with QIR at four levels (QIR 1-4; index tests). Global noise index, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and voxel-wise CT attenuation differences were measured. Noise and texture, artifacts, diagnostic confidence, and overall quality were assessed qualitatively. Conspicuity of hypodense liver lesions was rated by four readers. Parametric (analyses of variance, paired t tests) and nonparametric tests (Friedman, post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) were used to compare quantitative and qualitative image quality among reconstructions. Results: In the phantom, NPS showed unchanged noise texture across reconstructions with maximum spatial frequency differences of 0.01 per millimeter. Fifty patients (mean age, 59 years 6 16 [standard deviation]; 31 women) were included. Global noise index was reduced from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 45% for 60 keV and by 44% for T3D (both, P < .001). CNR of the liver improved from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 74% for 60 keV and by 69% for T3D (both, P < .001). No evidence of difference was found in mean attenuation of fat and liver (P =.79-.84) and on a voxel-wise basis among reconstructions. Qualitatively, QIR-4 outperformed all reconstructions in every category for 60 keV and T3D (P value range, <= 001 to.01). All four readers rated QIR-4 superior to other strengths for lesion conspicuity (P value range, <= 001 to.04). Conclusion: In portal venous abdominal photon-counting detector CT, an iterative reconstruction algorithm (QIR; Siemens Healthcare) at high strength levels improved image quality by reducing noise and improving contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion conspicuity without compromising image texture or CT attenuation values.

Because the quality is uncontrollable during cutting large 2D nanosheets to small 0D nanodots by top-down methods and the yield is low for GQDs with high quality obtained from bottom-up strategy. Here, aphanitic graphite (AG), a low-cost graphite contains a large amount of small graphite nanocrystals with size of about 10 nm is used as the precursor of graphene oxide quantum dots (GO-QDs) for the first time. GO-QDs with high yield and high quality were successfully obtained directly by liquid phase exfoliating AG without high strength cutting. The yield of these GO-QDs can reach up to 40 wt. %, much higher than that obtained from flake graphite (FG) precursor (less than 10 wt. %). The size of GO-QDs can be controlled in 2-10 nm. The average thickness of GO-QDs is about 3 nm, less than 3 layer of graphene sheet. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with different surface properties can be easily obtained by simple hydrothermal treatment of GO-QDs, which can be used as highly efficient fluorescent probe.

It is used to store the records behind the cryptocurrencies network. This record keeping technology is decentralized, secure digital records, and public ledger of cryptocurrency transac- tions, which is collectively well maintained by various users in the world, rather than by one central administration. Only the parties can create the entries and not possible to alter or delete it. Anyone can check the integrity of the transaction record within the network or outside the network by using simple manipulation. Blockchain technology is continuously evolving to its next stage, which is referred to as quantum blockchain. Quantum blockchain is referred to as a distributed, encoded, and decentralized database system based on quantum computation and quantum information theory. It is more securable because, once the data is stored, then it will not have been maliciously tampered. Even though it has more advantages, it has some security threats and privacy issues. Security issues are attacks to unauthorized resources that are protected by some coding or scripts. Privacy issues mean accessing the private information of a person or organization. It involves the security breaches from their vulnerabilities. Security in quantum blockchain is defined as it gives more protection to transactional information and data in the block from various threats such as internal and peripheral, malevolent, and unintentional threats. Typically, security involves finding of threat, the anticipation of threat, and suitable countermeasures to the threats using security policies, tools, and IT services. Security is one of the major concerns to solve the current computational hardness. Many cryptographic systems and algorithms are more vulnerable against quantum computers. Thus, that is breakable by quantum computers. Hence, with the help of quantum computer and quantum technology, we can make the blockchain more secure. Hence, we are in the position to give privacy and security to all the users and groups for their information and perform transactions without leaking identification information. In addition, it allows a user to remain compliant by discerningly revealing themselves without exposing their actions to the whole network.

But on account of steadily growing data warehouse, the query response time is generally in hours and weeks. Materialised view is an efficient approach to facilitate timely extraction of information and knowledge for strategic business decision making.

However, existing crowdsourcing platforms or systems could suffer from task allocation and quality control problems. In this article, we first prove that there exist two dilemmas while tackling the above issues by using a game-Theoretic approach. To overcome this challenge, we are focusing on exploiting quantum crowdsourcing schemes in which the welfare of requestor or worker can be maximized since quantum players share the extended strategy space, and the introduction of entanglement offers a new method of depicting fine-grained relations between players. Specifically, we propose a quantum game model for quota-oriented crowdsourcing game to address dilemmas in task allocation. The result indicates the dilemma based on classical strategy will disappear with the increment of entanglement degree. While in the quality-oriented crowdsourcing game, we adopt a density matrix approach to calculate the optimal payoffs of both sides, which demonstrates the superiority of our quantum strategy. Moreover, our quantum scheme is generic since it is compatible with the schemes from a classical perspective. Hence, our noteworthy quantum crowdsourcing schemes offer a promising alternative route for tackling dilemmas in crowdsourcing scenarios.  ?? 2013 IEEE.","Quantum Analysis on Task Allocation and Quality Control for Crowdsourcing with Homogeneous Workers","Scopus: IEEE Trans.

There has been changes among the older persons in multiple dimensions that corresponds to quantity of life years lived as well as the quality of life. The existing multi-dimensional measures also consider the characteristics within a fixed old-age threshold framework which does not account for significant improvements in life expectancy over the years. We propose a new Multidimensional Old Age Threshold (MOAT) measure that accommodates different dimensions of quantity and quality of older persons. We achieve this through a modified framework of the Characteristic Approach. Our measure incorporates a forward-looking approach to measure ageing and specifies an old-age threshold for different countries after accounting for different dimensions of life expectancy, health and human capital. This method is more suitable for comparison across countries with distinct demographic and health achievements. The empirical application of our method using selected countries from Europe and Asia shows that the relative performance of countries differs in terms of MOAT in comparison to estimates based on existing measures, primarily due to the inclusion of the quality dimensions. Countries that have better performance in life expectancy, health and human capital have higher values of MOAT and a lower 'burden' of older persons in a cross-country perspective in comparison to the existing measures.","A multi-dimensional measure of population ageing accounting for Quantum and Quality in life years: An application of selected countries in Europe and Asia","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","Balachandran and  A; James and  KS","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:41:17,,,,

An important characteristic of an LSC is a concentration factor (C) that can be thought of as a coefficient of effective enlargement (or contraction) of the area of a solar cell when it is coupled to the LSC. Here we use analytical and numerical Monte Carlo modeling in addition to experimental studies of quantum-dot-based LSCs to analyze the factors that influence optical concentration in practical devices. Our theoretical model indicates that the maximum value of C achievable with a given fluorophore is directly linked to the LSC quality factor (Q(LSC)) defined as the ratio of absorption coefficients at the wavelengths of incident and reemitted light. In fact, we demonstrate that the ultimate concentration limit (C-0) realized in large-area devices scales linearly with the LSC quality factor and in the case of perfect emitters and devices without back reflectors is approximately equal to Q(LSC). To test the predictions of this model, we conduct experimental studies of LSCs based on visible-light emitting II-VI core/shell quantum dots with two distinct LSC quality factors. We also investigate devices based on near-infrared emitting CuInSexS2-x quantum dots for which the large emission bandwidth allows us to assess the impact of varied Q(LSC) on the concentration factor by simply varying the detection wavelength. In all cases, we find an excellent agreement between the model and the experimental observations, suggesting that the developed formalism can be utilized for express evaluation of prospective LSC performance based on the optical spectra of LSC fluorophores, which should facilitate future efforts on the development of high-performance devices based on quantum dots as well as other types of emitters.","Quality Factor of Luminescent Solar Concentrators and Practical Concentration Limits Attainable with Semiconductor Quantum Dots","AMER CHEMICAL SOC","Klimov and  VI; Baker and  TA; Lim and  J; Velizhanin and  KA; McDaniel and  H","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:45:20,,,,

To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software. Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities. We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.","Quantum Computing Platforms: Assessing the Impact on Quality Attributes and SDLC Activities","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","Sodhi and  B; Kapur and  R","",o,,1,2024-03-31 21:45:35,,,,

Due to the outstanding photoluminescence (PL) properties of quantum dots (QDs), a high-quality CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDbased fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) aptasensor for simultaneously monitoring the amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta O) and tau protein was proposed. By engineering the interior inorganic structure and inorganic-organic interface, water-soluble dual-color CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs with a near-unity PL quantum yield (>90%) and mono-exponential PL decay dynamics were generated. The pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bond interaction between the aptamer-functionalized dual-color QDs and gold nanorods@polydopamine (Au NRs@PDA) nanoparticles resulted in significant fluorescence quenching of the QDs through FRET. Upon the incorporation of the APO and tau protein, the fluorescence recovery of the QDs-DNA/Au NRs@PDA assembly was attained, providing the possibility of simultaneously assaying the two types of AD core biomarkers. The lower detection limits of 50 pM for A beta O and 20 pM for the tau protein could be ascribed to the distinguishable and robust fluorescence of QDs and broad spectral absorption of Au NRs@PDA.

However, existing Ag2Te QDs have severely hindered the application of in vivo bioimaging due to their poor fluorescence brightness and stability, so it is important to prepare Ag2Te QDs with high quantum yield and stability as well as high biocompatibility in the NIR-II window. Herein, we designed an integrated method for the preparation of water-soluble Ag2Te QDs by mutual adaptation of QD synthesis and surface modification. We first synthesized high-quality Ag2Te QDs with different NIR-II emission wavelengths and the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) up to 6.51% by rapidly injecting the TBP-Te precursor into a hot solvent to form a highly fluorescent Ag2Te core. Then water-dispersible Ag2Te QDs were obtained by direct exchange of the hydrophobic Ag2Te QD surface ligands with thiol ligands. The PLQY of the water-soluble Ag2Te QDs obtained by this method can still be maintained at 4.94%.

We use TCP(UDP)/IP over ATM as a testbed to develop the architecture. We measure the application-level QoS in terms of throughput, delay, round trip time, and loss to identify the base-line performance an application can expect from such an environment. From the no-load condition we measure the behavior of these protocols at various data rates and user submitted data block sizes. We demonstrate the trade-offs involved in obtaining high throughput, low delays, low round trip time, and zero losses at different data rates. We use host-load condition experiments to understand the interaction between the CPU-intensive jobs and the communication-intensive jobs. We use network-load condition experiments to observe interaction between multiple streams of the above two protocol-suites, and its effect on the application QoS. Given these observations we define the missing components in the current protocol architectures to provide tighter control on the QoS guarantees.

This follows from the vanishing of the quantum Hall effect plateau and of the corresponding minimum of the longitudinal magnetoresistance for a filling factor nu=1. Here positive magnetoresistance is observed, which is attributed to the presence of two types of holes with different mobilities. A quantitative analysis shows that these are mainly heavy holes having different mobilities in the sublayers that form. The difference of the mobilities indicates that the opposite heterointerfaces of the Ge layers are of different quality. It follows from an analysis of the shape of the quantum Hall effect plateau for nu=2 that the densities of holes in the sublayers formed are close and, consequently, that the profile of the potential wells is close to symmetric.

As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In ASM, services can select an appropriate encryption algorithm that satisfies the proper security level and performance metrics under the limit of the key generation rate. We also implement ASM under our RT-QKD platform, and evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ASM can select the optimal algorithm to meet the requirement of security and performance under an acceptable cost.","Providing Adaptive Quality of Security in Quantum Networks","IEEE","Zhao and  BK; Wei and  ZL; Liu and  B; Su and  JS; You and  I","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:49:58,,,,

We evaluate a (1) purely classical, (2) hybrid kernel, and (3) purely quantum classifier for video QoD congestion classification, where congestion is either low, medium or high, using QoD measurements from a real networking test-bed. Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower.

The paper is relevant to the professionalism of actuaries in general, and to those who assess the quantum of damages in particular. Quality framework theories propose that practitioners need to apply a range of technical and normative capabilities to provide a quality professional service. This paper suggests the various capabilities that are needed by actuaries in the field of assessment of the quantum of damages, and orders them by applying a quality framework. A methodology for practitioners to benchmark the quality of their practice is outlined. In South Africa, there is no formal curriculum, canon, or specific guidance for actuaries practising in this field. The paper therefore also contributes to the professionalisation of the field by reviewing and recording relevant literature, and provisionally filling gaps in it from personal experience of the author as practitioner in this field. The paper concludes by suggesting that this approach could also help professionalise other fields of actuarial practice.","PROMOTING QUALITY IN THE ACTUARIAL ASSESSMENT OF QUANTUM OF DAMAGES IN SOUTH AFRICA","ACTUARIAL SOC SOUTH AFRICA-ASSA","Lowther and  MW","",o,,-1,2024-03-31 21:50:21,,,,

The similarity analyses of samples were evaluated by systematically quantified fingerprint method from the qualitative and quantitative perspectives, in which the macro qualitative similarity (Sm) and the macro quantitative similarity (Pm) were used to reflect the differences within samples. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences between the UV or FTIR spectral quantum fingerprints and their original spectra (t-test, P-value 0.05). The correlation of them was satisfactory (Pearson's r > 0.9220), which indicated that spectral quantum fingerprint had a good application prospect in the quantitative analyses and quality control of REYS. A fused evaluation strategy was developed in equal weights to avoid the unilaterality of a single analytical technique. The fusion results (Sm > 0.98, 91.9% < Pm < 106.6%) showed that 15 batches of samples were divided into grade 1 and grade 2, indicating good quality consistency.
