These issues primarily lie in the complex infrastructure needed for integration. Key to the HPCQC integration is the creation of a unified hybrid quantum-classical toolchain that reduces latency and supports various quantum technologies. Other obstacles include hardware-related requirements like maintaining uptime and networking.

Many attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an answer (Harrah in Philos Sci 28:40???46, 1961, [1]). In this work, we have attempted to understand questions in a better way by using Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The properties of Quantum Computing (QC) have enabled classically intractable data processing. So, in this paper, we have performed question classification on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering) dataset using quantum-based classifier algorithms???quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe significant performance improvement. Hence, this experiment has helped in improving the quality of QA in general. ?? 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Implications of Deep Circuits in Improving Quality of Quantum Question Answering,Scopus: Stud.

Parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have emerged as a major driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative (e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a PQC are determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the performance of a PQC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this paper, we present training methodologies for PQC in a completely classical environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained PQC on a target NISQ hardware by as much as 21.91%.",Addressing Temporal Variations in Qubit Quality Metrics for Parameterized Quantum Circuits,IEEE,Alam and  M; Ash-Saki and  A; Ghosh and  S,1

For most problems, however, it is currently unknown whether quantum algorithms can provide an advantage, and if so by how much, or how to design quantum algorithms that realize such advantages. Many of the most challenging computational problems arising in the practical world are tackled today by heuristic algorithms that have not been mathematically proven to outperform other approaches but have been shown to be effective empirically. While quantum heuristic algorithms have been proposed, empirical testing becomes possible only as quantum computation hardware is built. The next few years will be exciting as empirical testing of quantum heuristic algorithms becomes more and more feasible.

https://www.scopus.c,Evaluation; Quantum Simulator; Software Quality,"In recent years, the demand for arithmetic power from all walks of life is growing, especially the increasing popularity of AIGC, which makes people realize that huge technological progress cannot be made without the support of large arithmetic power. Quantum computing may bring a leap in computing power and become a 'trigger' and 'catalyst' to accelerate the development of science and technology innovation, and its technical development trend and application prospects have become a hot issue of concern, and quantum simulators are a very important part of the development process. The development of quantum simulators is a very important part of the process. However, due to the lack of systematic evaluation theories and methods, it is difficult to quantify and analyze the quality of the increasing number of simulators on the market, which may hinder researchers from practicing their quantum algorithms objectively or developing quantum technologies.

Thus, it is perfectly feasible that during the next few years hybrid systems will start to appear integrating both the classical software systems of companies and new quantum ones providing solutions to problems that still remain unmanageable today. A natural way to support such integration is Service-Oriented Computing. While conceptually the invocation of a quantum software service is similar to that of a classical one, technically there are many differences and technological limitations, which refer to platform independence, decoupling, scalability, etc. To highlight these differences and the difficulties to develop quality quantum services, this paper takes a well-known problem to which a quantum solution can be provided, integer factorization, making use of??the Amazon Braket quantum service platform. The exercise of trying to provide the factorization as a quantum service is carried out following the best practices, design patterns and standards existing in the implementation of classical services.

Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower.

These obstacles make the creation of quantum applications a slow and complex process that requires specialized knowledge of quantum mechanics and computer science, which compromises the quality of quantum services. Therefore, the need to ensure an adequate level of quality in quantum software is fundamental. To address these challenges, this work proposes a process that enables developers to create high-quality quantum services in an automated and standardized way, using an extension of the OpenAPI specification. Furthermore, we analyze the challenges faced by NISQ devices, the most advanced quantum computers available today, due to errors and noise such as decoherence, gate errors, and readout errors. This process will make it possible to measure, at runtime, the stability and fidelity of the quantum circuits included in the generated quantum services. ?? 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Improving the Quality of Quantum Services Generation Process: Controlling Errors and Noise,Scopus: Lect.

The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an individual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semiempirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a (bio)molecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of druglike molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the three-dimensional conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP). To assess the quality and compatibility with standard force fields, we performed benchmark calculations for the free energy of hydration and liquid properties such as density and heat of vaporization.",Machine Learning of Partial Charges Derived from High-Quality Quantum-Mechanical Calculations,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,Bleiziffer and  P; Schaller and  K; Riniker and  S,1

Some quantum lab devices have been developed and important milestones have been reached, mainly in the branch of communications. In this scenario, it is urgent to educate people in quantum computing and technology, like it happens with disciplines such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics promoted by government in order to instruct science-aware citizens. A solid knowledge base in math and physics is essential for a workforce able to develop high quality quantum technology. This work addresses the necessity of quantum literacy for the creation of a new workforce, proposing the basic math tools, and physics background for entering into the field of quantum programming.

http://dx.doi.org/10,Quantum Computing; Quantum Software Engineering; Software Development Life Cycle; Computing Platforms,"Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software. Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities. We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.",Quantum Computing Platforms: Assessing the Impact on Quality Attributes and SDLC Activities,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,Sodhi and  B; Kapur and  R,1

In the present paper, feature and data prototype selection techniques were studied to tackle this challenge. A grid search was performed and quantum machine learning models were trained and benchmarked against classical shallow machine learning methods, trained both in the reduced and the complete datasets. The performance of the quantum algorithms was found to be comparable to the classical ones, even when using large datasets. Sequential Backward Selection and Principal Component Analysis techniques were used for feature's selection and while the former can produce the better quantum machine learning models in specific cases, it is more unstable. Additionally, we show that such variability in the results is caused by the use of discrete variables, highlighting the suitability of Principal Component analysis transformed data for quantum machine learning applications in the high energy physics context.

This method is divided into two parts: quality feature extraction and pattern classification. By combining Quantum Genetic Algorithm(QGA) and K-means algorithm, a quantum genetic clustering algorithm based on a mechanism for determining the rotation direction of a quantum rotary gate is proposed, and its performance is verified by experimental simulation. Based on the clustering analysis of quality data using the quantum genetic algorithm proposed in this paper, a control chart feature description method is proposed. With this feature as input, Support Vector Machine is used to identify the corresponding quality control chart pattern.The proposed quantum genetic clustering algorithm obtains better clustering results,and the accuracy of the proposed control chart recognition method reaches 98.63%. ?? 2019, The Editorial Board of Journal of System Simulation.

We develop a technique that takes advantage of a quantum-classical hybrid infrastructure called Quantum-Enhanced Codecs (QEC). We evaluate a (1) purely classical, (2) hybrid kernel, and (3) purely quantum classifier for video QoD congestion classification, where congestion is either low, medium or high, using QoD measurements from a real networking test-bed. Findings show that the SVC performs the classification task 4% better in the low congestion state and the kernel method performs 6.1% and 10.1% better for the medium and high congestion states. Empirical evidence suggests that when the SVC is trained on a very low amount of data, the classification accuracy varies significantly depending on the quality of the training data, however, the variance in classification accuracy of quantum models is significantly lower. Classical video QoD classifiers benefit from the quantum data embedding techniques. They learn better decision regions using less training data.  ?? 2023 IEEE.",Quantum Classifiers for Video Quality Delivery,"Scopus: Jt. European Conf.
