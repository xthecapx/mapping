However, they primarily focus on fixed quantum circuits rather than the procedure of building quantum circuits. Despite being a common approach, the correctness of building circuits using different parameters following the same procedure is not guaranteed. To this end, we propose a designby-contract framework for quantum software. Our framework provides a python-embedded language to write assertions on the input and output states of all quantum circuits built by certain procedures. Additionally, it provides a method to write assertions about the statistical processing of measurement results to ensure the procedure's correctness for obtaining the final result. These assertions are automatically checked using a quantum computer simulator. For evaluation, we implemented our framework and wrote assertions for some widely used quantum algorithms. Consequently, we found that our framework has sufficient expressive power to verify the whole procedure of quantum software.",10,0,0,0,0,,,979-8-3503-0180-9,,2023,10.1109/Q-SE59154.2023.00010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Q-SE59154.2023.00010,2,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Quantum Science & Technology",Computer Science; Physics,BV4QP,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cross-Framework Portability of Quantum Software,2022 IEEE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE COMPANION (ICSA-C 2022),English,Proceedings Paper,,,"In recent years, various vendors have made quantum software frameworks available. Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk, especially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet reached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies are still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum programming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the established architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of abstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet software architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives, namely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off unnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally explore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks from the software implementation perspective. We find that for several specific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the problem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise description, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving framework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue, based on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between frameworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- and framework-specific portions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere hundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum programming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off unnecessary abstraction levels.",62,2,2,0,0,,,978-1-6654-9493-9,,2022,10.1109/ICSA-C54293.2022.00039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSA-C54293.2022.00039,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Computer Science,BT5WB,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the last years, all major companies have provided frameworks and programming languages that allow developers to create their quantum applications. This shift has led to the definition of a new discipline called quantum software engineering, which is demanded to define novel methods for engineering large-scale quantum applications. While the research community is successfully embracing this call, we notice a lack of systematic investigations into the state of the practice of quantum programming. Understanding the challenges that quantum developers face is vital to precisely define the aims of quantum software engineering. Hence, in this paper, we first mine all the GITHUB repositories that make use of the most used quantum programming frameworks currently on the market and then conduct coding analysis sessions to produce a taxonomy of the purposes for which quantum technologies are used. In the second place, we conduct a survey study that involves the contributors of the considered repositories, which aims to elicit the developers' opinions on the current adoption and challenges of quantum programming. On the one hand, the results highlight that the current adoption of quantum programming is still limited. On the other hand, there are many challenges that the software engineering community should carefully consider: these do not strictly pertain to technical concerns but also socio-technical matters.

First, a quantum programming language should provide an intuitive programming interface to describe those algorithms. Then a compiler has to transform the program into a quantum circuit, optimize it, and map it to the target quantum processor respecting the hardware constraints such as the supported quantum operations, the qubit connectivity, and the control electronics limitations.

A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity. This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDIFF with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy. We evaluate QDIFF with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDIFF on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDIFF's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",62,8,8,2,5,,,978-1-6654-0337-5,,2021,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678792,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678792,13,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Computer Science,BS9CZ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

These procedures apply a spectral approach to matrix representations - e.g. the Laplacian - of the software system. Recent intensive research efforts towards quantum computers have increased expectations that quantum computing could in due time materialize as a practical alternative to classical computing. It is reasonable to inquire about quantum software desirable features and prepare in advance modular design procedures for quantum software systems. However, it does not make sense to have two totally separate procedures for modular design, one for classical software systems and another for quantum software systems. This paper claims that there should be just a single unified and rigorous design procedure for both classical and quantum software systems. Our common design procedure starting point for both classical and quantum software systems is Von Neumann's quantum notion of Density Operator and its Density Matrix representation. This paper formulates and demonstrates modular design in terms of projection operators obtained from a design Density Matrix and shows their equivalence to the Linear Software Models results of the Laplacian matrix spectrum for the classical case.

In particular, recently, plans for building quantum internet have been put into action and expected to be launched by 2020 in the Netherlands. Quantum internet uses quantum communication as well as quantum entanglement along with classical communication. This makes design of software platform for quantum networks very challenging and a daunting task. Seamless design and testing of platforms for quantum software, thus, becomes a necessity to develop complex simulators for this kind of networks. In this short paper, we argue that using coordination models such as Reo can significantly simplify the development of software applications for quantum internet. Moreover, formal verification of such quantum software becomes possible, thanks to the separation of concerns, compositionality, and reusability of Reo models. This paper introduces an extension of a recently developed simulator for quantum internet (SimulaQron) by incorporating Reo models extended with quantum data and operations, along with classical data. We explain the main concepts and our plan for implementing this extension as a new tool: SimulaQ(reo)n.",15,0,0,0,0,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-04771-9; 978-3-030-04770-2,,2018,10.1007/978-3-030-04771-9_23,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-04771-9_23,9,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BT9VN,Green Published,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, security vulnerabilities are also emerg-ing that could hinder the progress of quantum computing, as well as its transition and development in industry. For this reason, this article proposes a review of some of the first artefacts that are emerging in the field of quantum computing. From this analysis, we begin to identify possible security issues that could become potential vulnerabilities in the quantum software of tomorrow. Likewise, and following the experience in classical software development, the testing technique is analysed as a possible candidate for improving security in quantum software development.

This means that developers must assume a different attitude towards programming, and aim at error-free software before its execution. This is commonly facilitated using simulators, which are commonplace for both HPC and QC. However the fashion developers advance from one tool to another is ad-hoc, with no established software engineering guidelines, and the final step from simulators to HPC/QC is still a leap of faith, comparable to releasing software. In this paper, we propose a vision where developers can iterate in an agile fashion when developing quantum software.

In the era of quantum computing, Shor's algorithm running on QCs can break asymmetric encryption algorithms that classical computers practically cannot. Though the exact date when QCs will become dangerousfor practical problems is unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, the software engineering community needs to start making software ready for quantum attacks and ensure quantum safety proactively.Objective: We argue that the problem of evolving existing software to quantum-safe software is very similar to the Y2K bug. Thus, we leverage some best practices from the Y2K bug and propose our roadmap, called 7E, which gives developers a structured way to prepare for quantum attacks. It is intended to help developers start planning for the creation of new software and the evolution of cryptography in existing software.Method: In this paper, we use a case study to validate the viability of 7E. Our software under study is the IBM Db2 database system. We upgrade the current cryptographic schemes to post-quantum cryptographic ones (using Kyber and Dilithium schemes) and report our findings and lessons learned.Results: We show that the 7E roadmap effectively plans the evolution of existing software security features towards quantum safety, but it does require minor revisions.

Existing quantum programming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of 1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this quantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the specified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a mismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and their underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly translating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient, high-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal quantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations into larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology then optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate operations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom control pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and 2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the proposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum software and low-level, physical quantum hardware. We evaluate our approach on important near-term quantum applications on simulations of superconducting quantum architectures. Our proposed approach provides a mean speedup of 5x, with a maximum of 10x.

However, the main results on quantum walk search are scattered over different, incomparable frameworks, such as the hitting time framework, the MNRS framework, and the electric network framework. As a consequence, a number of pieces are currently missing. For example, recent work by Ambainis et al. (STOC'20) shows how quantum walks starting from the stationary distribution can always find elements quadratically faster. In contrast, the electric network framework allows quantum walks to start from an arbitrary initial state, but it only detects marked elements. We present a new quantum walk search framework that unifies and strengthens these frameworks, leading to a number of new results. For example, the new framework effectively finds marked elements in the electric network setting. The new framework also allows to interpolate between the hitting time framework, minimizing the number of walk steps, and the MNRS framework, minimizing the number of times elements are checked for being marked. This allows for a more natural tradeoff between resources. In addition to quantum walks and phase estimation, our new algorithm makes use of quantum fast-forwarding, similar to the recent results by Ambainis et al. This perspective also enables us to derive more general complexity bounds on the quantum walk algorithms, e.g., based on Monte Carlo type bounds of the corresponding classical walk. As a final result, we show how in certain cases we can avoid the use of phase estimation and quantum fast-forwarding, answering an open question of Ambainis et al.",25,10,10,0,4,1868-8969,,978-3-95977-180-1,,2021,10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2021.6,http://dx.doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2021.6,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BR1TW,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

This exposition dares to ask a bold question of how to make adiabatic quantum computation fit into the rapidly progressing framework of quantum automata theory. As our answer to this eminent but profound question, we first lay out a basic framework of adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems (AEQSs) with limited computational resources and then establish their close connection to quantum finite automata. We also explore fundamental structural properties of languages solved quickly by such adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems.",16,0,0,0,0,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-23247-4; 978-3-030-23246-7,,2019,10.1007/978-3-030-23247-4_22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-23247-4_22,13,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BU2GP,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, the increased availability of computational resources has also contributed to an influx in the development of quantum programs. Given that classical and QC are significantly different due to the intrinsic nature of quantum programs, several aspects of QC (e.g., performance, bugs) have been investigated, and novel approaches have been proposed. However, from a purely quantum perspective, maintenance, one of the major steps in a software development life-cycle, has not been considered by researchers yet. In this paper, we fill this gap and investigate the prevalence of code smells in quantum programs as an indicator of maintenance issues. We defined eight quantum-specific smells and validated them through a survey with 35 quantum developers. Since no tool specifically aims to detect quantum smells, we developed a tool called QSmell that supports the proposed quantum-specific smells. Finally, we conducted an empirical investigation to analyze the prevalence of quantum-specific smells in 15 open-source quantum programs. Our results showed that 11 programs (73.33%) contain at least one smell and, on average, a program has three smells. Furthermore, the long circuit is the most prevalent smell present in 53.33% of the programs.",89,1,1,3,3,0270-5257,,978-1-6654-5701-9,,2023,10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00041,13,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BV4JK,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, qubits are fickle and error prone. It is necessary to actively correct errors in the execution of a quantum circuit. Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are developed to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. With QEC, one logical circuit is converted into an encoded circuit. Most studies on quantum circuit compilation focus on NISQ devices which have 10-100 qubits and are not fault-tolerant. In this paper, we focus on the compilation for fault-tolerant quantum hardware. In particular, we focus on optimizing communication parallelism for the surface code based QEC. The execution of surface code circuits involves non-trivial geometric manipulation of a large lattice of entangled physical qubits. A two-qubit gate in surface code is implemented as a virtual pipe in space-time called a braiding path. The braiding paths should be carefully routed to avoid congestion. Communication between qubits is considered the major bottleneck as it involves scheduling and searching for simultaneous paths between qubits. We provide a framework for efficiently scheduling braiding paths. We discover that for quantum programs with a local parallelism pattern, our framework guarantees an optimal solution, while the previous greedy-heuristic-based solution cannot.

In this work, we introduce an extensive framework of Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypotheses, as quantum analogues to what SETH is for classical computation.

When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to performance.

On the theoretical side, a lot of effort is put into designing error-correcting codes that protect quantum data from errors, which inevitably happen due to the noisy nature of quantum hardware and quantum bits (qubits). Protecting data with an error-correcting code necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially corrupted data set-a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding algorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner. While theoretical properties of certain QEC methods have been extensively studied, good techniques to analyze their performance in practically more relevant settings is still a widely unexplored area. In this work, we propose a set of software tools that facilitate numerical experiments with so-called Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes (QLDPC codes)-a broad class of codes, some of which have recently been shown to be asymptotically good.

However, as the number and possible values of input parameters increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises. This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's search algorithm. This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O (N), where.. represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O (epsilon(-1)root N/K), where.. is a relative error of measuring... The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations.

But their actual qubit numbers are small, and the error rates are high. However, quantum computers are already used in various areas and a steadily increasing number is made available by cloud providers. To execute a quantum circuit, it is mapped to the quantum computer's hardware. The resulting compiled circuit strongly influences the precision of the execution in terms of occurring errors caused by used qubits and quantum gates. Selecting an optimal one is, therefore, essential. SDKs are used to implement circuits and differ in supported cloud providers and programming languages. These differences complicate a change to other backends. In previous work, we developed an automated framework to translate a given circuit and compile it on available quantum computers using multiple compilers. The compilation results can be prioritized and executed.

To address both issues, in this paper we use Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as a vehicle to present a novel compression-aided framework, namely QuCAD, which will adapt a trained QNN to fluctuating quantum noise.

By discussing the opportunities of quantum mechanics for design, we are proposing a framework to model and measure ambiguous dimensions of design through quantum superpositions. The proposed framework includes the dimensions for the directionality of design (convergence or divergence), the degree of design embodiment (from low to high) and the decision-making of the designer (yes to no). Once the designer attempts the measurement of a superposition, a binary state can be distilled. For the act of designing, filling in the blanks is equal to sculpting away superposed states.

Furthermore, they can also have a significant role in the creation of future Quantum Networks (QNs). As a matter of fact, the use of drones allows deploying a non terrestrial Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (QMAN), overcoming Optical Fibers' (OFs) limits, due to the large percentage of photons that scatters before reaching the receiver. However, random fluctuations of drones' positions and atmospheric turbulence can affect the quality of the Free Space Optic (FSO) link with a significant impact on performance. Considering that Quantum Drone Networks (QDNs) require significant control, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm can play a key role in their provisioning. Specifically, an SDN Controller is responsible for managing the global strategies for the distribution of end-to-end (E2E) entangled pairs. Therefore, this paper provides the design of an SDN-based architecture for supporting high-performance Metropolitan Quantum Drone Networks (MQDNs) with a specific protocol for creating entanglement between two Ground Stations (GSs) through the swarm of drones. The proposed architecture can be employed for distributed quantum computing applications and entanglement-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) services. Moreover, a suited objective function to optimize the planning and operation of the swarm mission has been proposed. Finally, the paper provides a performance evaluation considering the most relevant metrics, such as fidelity, entanglement rate, and the overhead of the proposed protocol, pointing out that even higher performance than OFs is achievable.",78,2,2,1,3,2169-3536,,,,2022,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3226127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3226127,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,6X7ZS,gold,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the past few years, a multitude of hardware platforms, algorithms, and programming languages have emerged to support this paradigm. By the very nature of Quantum Mechanics principles, there is an enormous change of philosophy when building quantum programs, which operate in a probabilistic space, unlike the deterministic behaviour shown by classical programming languages. These conceptual differences can be overcome by using techniques and tools of Software Engineering. In this paper, we apply Model-Driven Engineering techniques in a systematic way to ease the generation of quantum programs and we apply it to solve the satisfiability problem, very important in many engineering domains like verification of discrete systems and test of integrated circuits.

This model-driven infrastructure is employed to automatically generate quantum programs from SAT equations through a model-to-model transformation that embeds Grover's algorithm.

In this paper, we give a general framework for implementing quantum query algorithms efficiently in a Quantum CONGEST network, using the concept of parallel-query quantum algorithms. We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries in two settings: problems where data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical problems where the network defines the input. The first setting is slightly unusual in CONGEST but here our results follow almost directly from the quantum query setting. The second setting is more traditional for the CONGEST model but here our framework requires also some classical CONGEST steps to apply. In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can pick one of k dates for a meeting such that a maximum number of nodes is available, using (O) over tilde(root kD + D) rounds, with D the network diameter. The classical complexity is linear in k. We also give an efficient algorithm for element distinctness: if all nodes together holds a list of k numbers, we show that the nodes can determine whether there are any duplicates in (O) over tilde (k(2/3) D-1/3 + D) rounds. Classically this problem requires (Omega) over tilde (k + D) rounds. We also generalize the protocol for the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting considered by Buhrman, Cleve, and Wigderson [4] to general networks. This gives a novel separation between exact classical and exact quantum protocols in the CONGEST model. In the setting where the input is the network structure itself, our framework almost directly allows us to recover the O(root nD) round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez [21]. We extend this approach to also compute the radius in the same number of rounds, and to give an epsilon-additive approximation of the average eccentricity in (O) over tilde (D-3/2/epsilon) rounds. Finally, we give the first quantum speedups over classical CONGEST for the problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a graph has a cycle of length at most k in O(k + (kn)(1/2-1/Theta(k))) rounds. For girth computation, we give an (O) over tilde (g + (gn)(1/2-1/Theta(g))) round algorithm for graphs with girth g, beating the classical Omega(root n) round lower bound by Frischknecht, Holzer, and Wattenhofer [12].",29,0,0,0,0,,,978-1-4503-9262-4,,2022,10.1145/3519270.3538413,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3519270.3538413,11,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BV4HR,"Bronze, Green Submitted",2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Existing implementations of SIKE either focus on dedicated accelerators on FPGA platforms or on assembly optimized software implementations on ARM. A full FPGA implementation, though offering low latency and high performance, suffers from the disadvantage of having a large area footprint and a low flexibility.

The result shows that our implementation on ARM Cortex-A9 enhanced with a field accelerator offers significant speedup in terms of clock cycles when compared to standalone software implementations on ARM32 and ARM64.

Existing approaches generally utilize a combination of multimodal features in a somehow heuristic way.

In this study, value-encoded quantum circuits for convolution and pooling operations are proposed to apply deep learning in quantum computers in a traditional and proven way. To construct the convolution and pooling operations, some modules such as addition, multiplication, division, and comparison are created. In addition, a window-based framework for quantum image processing applications is proposed. The generated convolution and pooling circuits are simulated on the IBM QISKIT simulator in parallel thanks to the proposed framework. The obtained results are verified by the expected results.

Hence, deviated from problems such as state tomography, our samples are i.i.d density operators. The second challenge is even more profound since we must realize that our only interaction with a quantum state is through a measurement which - due to no-cloning quantum postulate - loses information after measuring it.

An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel opensource framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm.

Method: First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers. Results: The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC. Conclusion: By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.",138,30,30,4,17,0950-5849,1873-6025,,2022 JUL,2022,10.1016/j.infsof.2022.106896,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2022.106896,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Computer Science,4L8PL,"Green Accepted, hybrid",2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

An attacker can inject false messages to a vehicle's CAN via wireless communication, the infotainment system, or the onboard diagnostic port. Thus, an effective intrusion detection system is essential to distinguish authentic CAN messages from false ones. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework using a classical neural network (NN) and a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). The classical NN is dedicated to feature extraction from CAN images generated from a vehicle's CAN bus data. In contrast, the quantum RBM is dedicated to CAN image reconstruction for classification-based intrusion detection. The novelty of the study lies in utilizing the generative ability of an RBM to reconstruct the pixels in a CAN image, a portion of which is dedicated to labeling. Then, that portion of the reconstructed image is used to classify the image as an attack image or a normal image. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid quantum-classical CAN intrusion detection framework, we used a real-world CAN fuzzy attack dataset to create three separate attack datasets, where each dataset represents a unique set of features related to the vehicle. We compared the performance of our hybrid framework to a similar but classical-only framework. Our analyses showed that the hybrid framework performs better in CAN intrusion detection compared to the classical-only framework. For the three datasets considered in this study, the best models in the hybrid framework achieved 97.5%, 97%, and 98.3% intrusion detection accuracies and 94.7%, 93.9%, and 97.2% recalls, respectively.

These new concepts allow operators to automate the setup of services, thus reducing costs in deploying and operating the required infrastructure. On the other hand, these novel paradigms expose new vulnerabilities, as critical information travels through the infrastructure from central offices, down to remote data centers and network devices. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a state-of-the-art technology that can be seen as a source of symmetric keys in two separated domains. It is immune to any algorithmic cryptanalysis and is thus suitable for long-term security. This technology is based on the laws of physics, which forbids us from copying the quantum states exchanged between two endpoints from which a secret key can be extracted. Thus, even though it has some limitations, a correct implementation can deliver keys of the highest security. In this paper, we propose the integration of QKD systems with well-known protocols and methodologies to secure the network's control plane in an SDN and NFV environment.

To make a quantum circuit effectively executable, a circuit transformation process is necessary to transform it, with overhead cost the smaller the better, into a functionally equivalent one so that the connectivity constraints imposed by the quantum processing unit are satisfied. Although several algorithms have been proposed for this goal, the overhead costs are often very high, which degenerates the fidelity of the obtained circuits sharply. One major reason for this lies in that, due to the high branching factor and vast search space, almost all of these algorithms only search very shallowly, and thus, very often, only (at most) locally optimal solutions can be reached. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to tackle the circuit transformation problem, which enables the search process to go much deeper. The general framework supports implementations aiming to reduce either the size or depth of the output circuit through introducing SWAP or remote CNOT gates. The algorithms, called MCTS-Size and MCTS-Depth, are polynomial in all relevant parameters.

The rate of key distribution is low and decreases exponentially with increasing distance. A classic trusted relay (CTR) uses additional keys to enhance security distance in QKD networks. In practice, the assurance of security for certain relay nodes is still lacking, despite the fact that CTR requires that all nodes be trusted. Owing to channel unreliability, system faults accumulate during the key relay, thereby increasing the probability of CTR failing to distribute the secret key. The failure of a successful key relay would then result in the subsequent destruction of all the keys involved in the process, which leads to the wasting of the quantum secret key and reduction system encryption. Hence, alleviating the effect of CTR failure for the purpose of obtaining key security distribution of distant quantum network is necessary issue to tackle. Therefore, a new scheme is needed in order to overcome the above-mentioned issues to come up with a better utilization of the generated keys. In this study, a software-defined networking (SDN) technique is introduced to circumvent this drawback by utilising the flexibility provided by the SDN paradigm for better QKD network management. In particular, a novel survivability model called software-defined quantum key relay failure (SDQKRF) is proposed in this paper in which a new function is developed and added to the SDN controller.

We then extend the language and axioms of the original ZX calculus, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory through a translation between ZX and ZW specialised to the field of complex numbers.

However, existing quantum programming environments mostly require an in-depth understanding of the basic QC building blocks, that is, quantum states, superposition, entanglement and measurement as well as the changing of quantum states using basic quantum gates. The present state of quantum programming reminds us of how Classical Computing was about 70 years ago when computing machines such as the ENIAC required significant effort to program solely using very basic digital building blocks. Over the decades, though, increasingly higher-level abstractions have been created on top of the basic building blocks of Classical Computing and made computation much more accessible and wide-spread. In order to make Quantum Computing more accessible, we argue that Software Engineering for QC needs to embark on a similar journey and create abstractions that shield developers from the basic QC building blocks as much as possible so that they can focus their attention on solving problems and less on how to manipulate quantum states using quantum circuits.

As a metaheuristic algorithm, ant colony optimization (ACO) is modified and applied. Instead of modeling ants pursuing higher pheromone densities, the proposed framework predicts pheromone traits using the intermediate pheromone density. As the pheromone volumes in the intermediate stage fluctuate, they are modeled using a quantum mechanism. Thereafter, the following pheromone traits are estimated using the modeled stochastic differential equation and Ito integral. The predicted pheromones are used for the parameters in the subsequent ACO iterations.

Many multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approaches have been widely studied. In a MAGDM problem, the multiple DMs are usually regarded as independent. However, in many practical situations, the opinions from different DMs are likely to influence each other or to be affected by the environment. To address it, a quantum framework based on quantum probability theory is proposed in this paper. The goal is to model the subjectivity in MAGDM when we have subjective beliefs towards DMs' independence or relations. The modeled subjectivity sources from the interference of beliefs. However, in classical models, subjectivity usually comes from the preference of DMs when determining weights or giving an evaluation towards alternatives. In this paper, the classical MAGDM technics are used to do the preparation firstly. Then a Bayesian network is constructed and it is extended to a quantum framework. The beliefs toward DMs are in a superposition. Namely, the opinions of DMs are viewed as various wave functions that are occurring at the same time. Then the beliefs will interfere with each and influence the final result. When all the DMs are deemed independent, the quantum framework will degenerate into a classical Bayesian network. The various cases of a simple example have been discussed and analyzed. A real supplier section problem is also used to illustrate and validate our model. Finally, an overall comparative analysis regarding the subjectivity in MAGDM is performed.",79,25,27,4,57,0360-8352,1879-0550,,OCT,2018,10.1016/j.cie.2018.08.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2018.08.001,13,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Industrial",Computer Science; Engineering,GT6XO,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

We show that the resulting scheme satisfies a stronger quantum computational binding property, which we will call predicate-binding, than the trivial honest-binding. Intuitively and very roughly, the predicate-binding property guarantees that given any inconsistent predicate pair over a set of strings (i.e. no strings in this set can satisfy both predicates), if a (claimed) quantum commitment can be opened so that the revealed string satisfies one predicate with certainty, then the same commitment cannot be opened so that the revealed string satisfies the other predicate (except for a negligible probability).

It leads to an exponential growth of the computational complexity of even most elementary quantum mechanical calculations, not to mention more advanced computational tasks, such as the ones required for studying the metrological potential of quantum states, e.g. computation of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Solution method: Thanks to the use of the tensor-network formalism, where quantum states are represented as matrix product states and operators as matrix product operators, it is possible to obtain an efficient description where space complexity scales linearly with the number of elementary particles constituting the physical system. Furthermore, it is possible to efficiently optimize QFI over quantum states and operators in those representations, applying the ideas presented in [1]. This allows to study sophisticated quantum metrological models that are beyond the grasp of the standard numerical methods utilizing the full Hilbert space representation of quantum states and operations.

The adoption of C++11 features has led to many simplifications in the codebase. A full doxygen-based API manual [1] is now provided together with updated user guides. A largely automated, versatile new testsuite directed both towards computational and physics features allows for quickly spotting arising errors. The states of trajectories are now savable and recoverable with full binary precision, allowing for trajectory continuation regardless of evolution method (single/ensemble Monte Carlo wave-function or Master equation trajectory). As the main new feature, the framework now presents Python bindings to the highest-level programming interface, so that actual simulations for given composite quantum systems can now be performed from Python.

RAM: The framework itself takes about 60MB, which is fully shared. The additional memory taken by the program which defines the actual physical system (script) is typically less than 1MB. The memory storing the actual data scales with the system dimension for state-vector manipulations, and the square of the dimension for density-operator manipulations.

Manipulation of such systems, with emphasis on dynamical simulations such as Master-equation evolution [4] and Monte Carlo wave-function simulation [5]. Solution method: Master equation, Monte Carlo wave-function method Reasons for new version: The new version is mainly a feature release, but it does correct some problems of the previous version, especially as regards the build system. Summary of revisions: We give an example for a typical Python script implementing the ring-cavity system presented in Sec. 3.3 of Ref. [2]: [GRAPHICS] Restrictions: Total dimensionality of the system. Master equation few thousands. Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory several millions. Unusual features: Because of the heavy use of compile-time algorithms, compilation of programs written in the framework may take a long time and much memory (up to several GBs). Additional comments: The framework is not a program, but provides and implements an application-programming interface for developing simulations in the indicated problem domain.

The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models transformed the OCL problems into a regression task. However, the abundant semantic information of the crowd scenes may lead the CNN framework hard to extract adequate features in order to ensure good precision In this work, a Quantum Image Feature Extraction with Dense Distribution-Aware Learning (QE-DAL) framework was proposed to handle this problem. The crowd features were extracted by Quantum layers, which were extracted by encoding, quantum circuits and decode procedures based on the multi-scale architecture. For handling objects, the refined distance compensating operator was adopted to fuse the multi-scale architecture. To relieve the computation burden, a Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism was proposed to initiate and update the bounding sizes of the objects via a point-supervised manner. Finally, the joint loss function, which describes pixel classes, density maps and offset bounding boxes, was built for QE-DAL. The ablation experiment results demonstrated that the effectiveness of the quantum feature extraction architecture and the Gaussian distribution estimation mechanism of QE-DAL was validated to show superior performance than the other state-of-the-art framework.

Some quantum simulators have been proposed, mainly divided into two categories: full-state simulators and tensor network simulators. The former consumes a lot of memory to hold the quantum state vectors. Therefore, the time overheads cost by calculation are much lower than that cost by memory-accesses and communications. Traditional optimization techniques such as latency hiding are not suitable for quantum simulation, and high-performance devices like GPGPUs cannot be fully utilized. This paper proposes DLC (Data Locality and Communication) optimizer to perform data locality and data layout optimizations. Both optimizations are based on the identification of amplitudes that can be processed by a sequence of quantum gates. They not only increase the data locality on the GPU side, but also reduces the date communication overheads and the times of data exchanges. In addition, layout data dynamically can significantly reduce the memory space on the GPGPU side for data communication. We evaluate our scheme on a small-scale CPU + GPU cluster. Experimental results show that for quantum circuits having 30-34 qubits, the ratio of communication to calculation increases from 12 to 79%, and a performance improvement 1.25-7x is achieved.

We evidence that classical probabilistic updating of information does not work correctly: hidden factors and motivations come into play to balance the conflicting cognitions and restore mental harmony. To support this inference we present a scheme of a 'gedanken experiment' in combination with known statistical data from a real experiment, the forbidden toy paradigm. Our findings show that the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance is a source of probabilistic non-classicality directly violating Bayes formula for conditional probability and so the law of total probability.

For example, we do not know how to prove that Shor's algorithm is strictly better than any classical algorithm, since we do not know the lower bound of time complexity of the factoring problem in Turing machine. In this paper, we consider the time-space complexity and prove strictly that quantum computing has advantages compared to their classical counterparts. We prove: (1) a time-space upper bound for recognition of the languages LINT (n) on two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFA): TS = O(n(3/2) log n), whereas a lower bound on probabilistic Turing machine is TS = Omega(n(2)); (2) a time-space upper bound for recognition of the languages L-NE(n) on exact 2QCFA: TS = O(n(1.87) log n), whereas a lower bound on probabilistic Turing machine is TS = Omega(n(2)).

Existing programming models for QC were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind, envisioning stand-alone applications. However, the susceptibility of nearterm quantum computers to noise limits their stand-alone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This modus operandi calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension specification, called QCOR, which enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the QCOR library-based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables.

The concurrence of the epistemic uncertainty and the aleatory uncertainty, especially when only the qualitative data are accessible, poses more challenges to the decision-making.

However, most of the existing decision-making methods for the probabilistic linguistic term sets depend on the aggregation operator. The subjectivity of the decision-makers and the decision-making behaviors are not fully considered. To solve this problem, a quantum-like probabilistic linguistic term decision-making framework is proposed, in which the quantum state, quantum data processing, and quantum interference effect are analyzed in detail. The decision-making beliefs of decision-makers are in a superposition state and their subjective relationships are depicted in the interference term.

Thanks to its construction of resistance-less wires and ultrafast switches, it can operate at clock frequencies of several tens of gigahertz and even hundreds of thousands of times as energy efficient as its CMOS counterparts. It has been perceived to be an important candidate to replace state-of-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency, as recognized by the U.S. IARPA C3 and SuperTools Programs and Japan MEXT-JSPS Project. The design and fabrication of superconducting circuits have already been established [2[44]. In addition, a prototype superconducting microprocessor Core 1 has been demonstrated in 2004 [3], which is able to execute instructions at a high clock frequency of several tens of gigahertz, and with extremely low-power dissipation. These achievements make superconducting electronics highly promising for future high-performance computing applications. As one of the most matured superconducting technology, the Rapid-Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) technology is proposed by K. Likharev, O. Mukhanoc, V. Semenov in 1985 [1]. Despite its capability to be operated at an ultra-high speed of hundreds of GHz while maintaining extremely low switching energy (10(-19)J), it suffers from an increasing static power due to on-chip resistors that are required for constant DC bias supply for the main RSFQ circuit. Numerous methods have been proposed to resolve the static power dissipation problem of RSFQ, including low-voltage RSFQ (LV-RSFQ) [5], reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) [6], LR-biased RSFQ [7] and energy-efficient single-flux quantum (eSFQ) [8]. The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) technology, on the other hand, uses AC bias/excitation currents as both multi-phase clock signal and power supply [9] to mitigate the power consumption overhead of DC bias while operating at a frequency of few GHz. Consequently, AQFP is remarkably energy efficient compared to RSFQ, albeit operating at a lower frequency. The energy-delay-product (EDP) of the AQFP circuits fabricated using processes such as the AIST standard process 2 (STP2) and the MIT-LL SFQ process [10], [11], is at least 200 times smaller than those of the other energy-efficient superconductor logics and is only three orders of magnitude larger than the quantum limit [9]. Physical testing results of an AQFP 8-bit carry-look-ahead adder and large scale circuits consisting up-to 10,000 AQFP logic gates have demonstrated the AQFP being a promising technology that is robust against circuit parameter variations [12]. Despite the high application potential of AQFP in VLSI circuits, a systematic, automatic synthesis framework for AQFP is imminent. There are two features of AQFP that restrict conventional CMOS synthesis methods being directly applied on AQFP. In spite of And-Or-Inverter(AOI) based representation, which conventional CMOS circuits highly relies on, AQFP circuits prefer majority gates. In fact, its two inputs AND and OR gates are also built with three inputs majority gate with one input being constant. In addition, given its clock-synchronized data propagation nature, AQFP technology requires all inputs to any gate having equal delay. In order to meet this balanced timing requirement, splitters and buffers need to be inserted to the circuit. As a matter of fact, some circuit size can be doubled even with optimum amount of buffers and splitters inserted. The buffer and splitter insertion method can have a huge impact on the overall resource consumption. As the design complexity increases, an unoptimized buffer and splitter insertion method could result in huge amount of unnecessary buffers and splitters added. In addition to a complete synthesis framework, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for AQFP design is also lacking. It is imminent to have an IDE for AQFP integrating tools that offer schematic and layout editor, simulation and analysis for better and more efficient AQFP design flow. In this paper, we propose a complete design tool for AQFP design including an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a complete majority based synthesis framework and a buffer and splitter insertion framework.we propose a majority gates synthesis framework for AQFP circuits that is capable of converting any AOI netlist to its corresponding MAJ netlist by mapping all feasible three-input sub-netlists to corresponding MAJ based implementations. In addition, we also propose an automated buffer and splitter insertion method that is capable of adding the optimum amount of buffers and splitters to any given gate-level netlist. The proposed method can find the minimum amount of buffers and splitters to inserted to achieve equal delay with any library limitation on the size of splitters. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods can deliver very optimized results. The majority conversion tool can reduce circuit size by an average of 16.47% and delay by 30.21% in average. The buffer and splitter insertion tool only introduces an average of 14.24% overhead in size and 4.70% delay with splitter fanout size limited to 4 compared to an unachievable ideal results with no limitations on splitter fan-out size. Overall, the balanced design in majority gates can be reduced by 23.85% and 29.54% in size and delay compared to its AND/OR/Inverter implemented counterpart.",15,0,0,0,3,2159-3469,2159-3477,978-1-7281-3391-1,,2019,10.1109/ISVLSI.2019.00042,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2019.00042,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BP0YC,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Compared to prior work achieving similar results, our technique does not require the encoding of the input or of the computation; instead, we rely on encryption of the input (together with a method to perform computations on encrypted inputs), and show that the random choice between three types of input (defining a computational run, versus two types of test runs) suffices. Because the overhead is very low for each run (it is linear in the size of the circuit), this shows that verification could be achieved at minimal cost compared to performing the computation.

The quantum-confined Adenine nanotube shows electronic transmission of the carrier at minimum stress. In this paper, the prediction of transmission spectra of the quantum-confined bio-molecular nanotube is investigated and deeply studied. Molecular level structure prediction and their electronic characterization can be possible with ab initio accuracy using a machine learning algorithmic approach.

In this study, we first employed classical computational methods to analyze a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker mini-superspace with a scalar field and visualize the calculated wavefunction of the universe for a variety of different values of the curvature of the universe and the cosmological constant. We then used IBM's Quantum Information Science Kit Python library and the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm to study the same systems on a quantum computer.

Unlike software-based quantum computation simulators, which run on standard general-purpose computers and suffer from reduced performance, this hardware design, which is based on classical concepts of bits, registers and memories, aims to leverage pure parallelism and pipelined execution for efficient quantum computations via emulation. The architecture includes several key components: memories, computation unit, measurement unit and control unit. The quantum state memory stores the individual and group states of qubits. This memory is crucial for maintaining the quantum information required for quantum operations. Basic operators are stored in dedicated operator memory. Additionally, a scratch memory allows for larger operators to be dynamically built at runtime. The computation unit is responsible for performing complex number multiplications, which form the basis of tensor and matrix products necessary for executing quantum operations. A measurement unit enables quantum state sampling, which is an essential aspect of quantum computation. Furthermore, a control unit is incorporated to ensure the correct operation of the quantum processor's data path. It utilizes a microprogram to manage and coordinate the functional units. All the functional units communicate with each other through dedicated and shared data buses, depending on the frequency of information exchange. This enables efficient data transfer and coordination among the components. The proposed hardware design has been simulated and proved to be effective in executing quantum operations. By exploiting parallelism and employing a pipelined execution, this architecture overcomes the limitations of software-based simulators, delivering improved performance for emulating quantum algorithms.

Adiabatic evolution of quantum systems has been studied as a potential means that physically realizes quantum computation. Up to now, all the research on adiabatic quantum systems has dealt with polynomial time-bounded computation and little attention has been paid to, for instance, adiabatic quantum systems consuming only constant memory space. Such quantum systems can be modeled in a form similar to quantum finite automata. This exposition dares to ask a bold question of how to make adiabatic quantum computation fit into the rapidly progressing framework of quantum automata theory. As our answer to this eminent but profound question, we first lay out a fundamental platform to carry out adiabatic evolutionary quantum systems (AEQSs) with limited computational resources (in size, energy, spectral gap, etc.) and then demonstrate how to construct such AEQSs by operating suitable families of quantum finite automata.

Ontologies analysis and appraisal are performed for measuring the eminence of an ontology. Ontologies evaluation is used to automatically reveal conceivability problems. For evaluating dynamic ontologies in semantic web and to set the weights to the neurons, Classical Neural Network (CNN) has to face a number of challenges such as the absence of discrete algorithm, limited memory capacity, time-consuming training due to the declarative nature of ontologies.

Thus, researchers in industry and academia have focused on designing in-fridge classical controllers in order to mitigate these challenges. Due to the maturity of CMOS logic, many industrial efforts (Microsoft, Intel) have focused on Cryo-CMOS as a near-term solution to design in-fridge classical controllers. Meanwhile, Superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) is an alternative, less mature classical logic family proposed for large-scale in-fridge controllers. SFQ logic has the potential to maximize scalability thanks to its ultra-high speed and very low power consumption. However, architecture design for SFQ logic poses challenges due to its unconventional pulse-driven nature and lack of dense memory and logic. Thus, research at the architecture level is essential to guide architects to design SFQ-based classical controllers for large-scale quantum machines. In this paper, we present DigiQ, the first system-level design of a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)-friendly SFQ-based classical controller. We perform a design space exploration of SFQ-based controllers and co-design the quantum gate decompositions and SFQ-based implementation of those decompositions to find an optimal SFQ-friendly design point that trades area and power for latency and control while ensuring good quantum algorithmic performance. Our co-design results in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) controller architecture, which has high scalability, but imposes new challenges on the calibration of control pulses. We present software-level solutions to address these challenges, which if unaddressed would degrade quantum circuit fidelity given the imperfections of qubit hardware. To validate and characterize DigiQ, we first implement it using hardware description languages and synthesize it using state-of-the-art/validated SFQ synthesis tools. Our synthesis results show that DigiQ can operate within the tight power and area budget of dilution refrigerators at >42,000-qubit scales.

Its scaling means not just the improvement of the instrument part, but also, mainly, mathematical and software tools, and our understanding of the QC problem. The first principle of quantum modeling is the reduction of reality to finite-dimensional models similar to QED in optical cavities. The second principle is a strict limitation of the so-called Feynman principle, the number of qubits in the standard formulation of the QC. This means treating decoherence exclusively as a limitation of the memory of a classical modeling computer, and introducing corresponding progressive restrictions on the working area of the Hilbert space of quantum states as the model expands. The third principle is similarity in processes of different nature.

A primary limiting factor is classical-to-quantum (C2Q) data encoding, which requires specific circuits for quantum state initialization. The required state initialization circuits are often complex and violate decoherence constraints, particularly for I/O intensive applications. Existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are noise-sensitive and have low quantum bit (qubit) counts, thus limiting the applicability of C2Q circuits for encoding large and realistic datasets. This has made the study of complete and realistic circuits that include data encoding challenging and has also led to a heavy dependency on costly and resource-intensive simulations on classical platforms. In this work, we propose a cost-effective, classical-hardware-accelerated framework for realistic and complete emulation of quantum algorithms. The emulation framework incorporates components for the critical C2Q data encoding process, as well as architectures for quantum algorithms such as the quantum Haar transform (QHT). The framework is used to investigate optimizations for C2Q and QHT algorithms, and the corresponding optimized quantum circuits are presented. The framework is implemented on a High-Performance Reconfigurable Computer (HPRC) which emulates the proposed QHT circuits combined with proposed C2Q data encoding methods. For performance benchmarks, CPU-based emulations and simulations on a state-of-the-art quantum computing simulator are also carried out.

Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate quantum supremacy, i.e., an advantage over classical computing.

However, the deployment of VQAs on contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant noise and prohibitively slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive supporting resources and infrastructure make quantum computers extremely keen on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized way of building up a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on a single physical device which tends to introduce ever-changing device-specific noise with less reliable performance as time-since-calibration grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble, which dynamically distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices, and adjusts the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In addition to reduced machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide significant speedups for VQA training. With this idea, we build a novel VQA training framework called EQC - a distributed gradient-based processor-performance-aware optimization system - that comprises: (i) a system architecture for asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytical model for assessing the quality of a circuit output concerning its architecture, transpilation, and runtime conditions; (iii) a weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational contribution according to the systems' current performance. Evaluations comprising 500K times' circuit evaluations across 10 IBMQ NISQ devices using a VQE and a QAOA applications demonstrate that EQC can attain error rates very close to the most performant device of the ensemble, while boosting the training speed by 10.5x on average (up to 86x and at least 5.2x).

The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm.

Existing quantum compilers use intermediate representations (IRs) where quantum programs are described as circuits. Such IRs fail to leverage existing work on compiler optimizations. In such IRs, it is non-trivial to statically check for physical constraints such as the no-cloning theorem, which states that qubits cannot be copied. We introduce QSSA, a novel quantum IR based on static single assignment (SSA) that enables decades of research in compiler optimizations to be applied to quantum compilation. QSSA models quantum operations as being side-effect-free. The inputs and outputs of the operation are in one-to-one correspondence; qubits cannot be created or destroyed. As a result, our IR supports a static analysis pass that verifies no-cloning at compile-time. The quantum circuit is fully encoded within the def-use chain of the IR, allowing us to leverage existing optimization passes on SSA representations such as redundancy elimination and dead-code elimination. Running our QSSA-based compiler on the QASMBench and IBM Quantum Challenge datasets, we show that our optimizations perform comparably to IBM's Qiskit quantum compiler infrastructure.

Our protocol is secure assuming the post-quantum security of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and Learning with Errors (LWE). This is the first succinct argument for quantum computation in the plain model; prior work (Chia-Chung-Yamakawa, TCC '20) requires both a long common reference string and non-black-box use of a hash function modeled as a random oracle. At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically verifiable quantum computation (Mahadev, FOCS '18). We give a self-contained, modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the verifier's first message (which consists of many public keys) is compressed. Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on indistinguishability obfuscation.

Quantum computing is limited, however, by the challenges of decoherence: i.e., a quantum state can only be maintained for short windows of time before it decoheres. While quantum error correction codes can protect against decoherence, fast execution time is the best defense against decoherence, so efficient architectures and effective scheduling algorithms are necessary. This paper proposes the Multi-SIMD QC architecture and then proposes and evaluates effective schedulers to map benchmark descriptions onto Multi-SIMD architectures. The Multi-SIMD model consists of a small number of SIMD regions, each of which may support operations on up to thousands of qubits per cycle. Efficient Multi-SIMD operation requires efficient scheduling. This work develops schedulers to reduce communication requirements of qubits between operating regions, while also improving parallelism. We find that communication to global memory is a dominant cost in QC. We also note that many quantum benchmarks have long serial operation paths (although each operation may be data parallel). To exploit this characteristic, we introduce Longest-Path-First Scheduling (LPFS) which pins operations to SIMD regions to keep data in-place and reduce communication to memory. The use of small, local scratchpad memories also further reduces communication. Our results show a 3% to 308% improvement for LPFS over conventional scheduling algorithms, and an additional 3% to 64% improvement using scratchpad memories.

In order to accommodate this new class of codes, a proper environment has to be created, which enables the interplay between the quantum and classical hardware. For many of these hybrid processes the coherence time of the quantum computer arises as a natural time constraint, making it crucial to minimize the classical overhead. For ion-trap quantum computers however, this is a much less limiting factor than with superconducting technologies, since the relevant timescale is on the order of seconds instead of microseconds. In fact, we show that the operating time-scales of trapped-ion quantum computers are compatible with the execution speed of the Python programming language, enabling us to develop an interpreted scheme for real-time control of quantum computations. In particular, compilation of all instructions in advance is not necessary, unlike with superconducting qubits.

The main reason for these costs is the expansion of QTs by using tensor product in multi-dimension quantum applications. In this work, new optimizations for the execution of reduction and decomposition based on the Identity operator are introduced in the Distributed Geometric Machine framework (D-GM). Instead of executing the quantum transformation in a single step, they are divided in sub-quantum transformations and only the values different from Identity transformations are stored.

Several protocols for verifiable delegated quantum computing have been proposed, but the client is not completely free from any quantum technology: the client has to generate or measure single-qubit states. In this paper, we show that the client can be completely classical if the server is rational (i.e., economically motivated), following the rational proofs framework of Azar and Micali. More precisely, we consider the following protocol. The server first sends the client a message allegedly equal to the solution of the problem that the client wants to solve. The client then gives the server a monetary reward whose amount is calculated in classical probabilistic polynomial-time by using the server's message as an input. The reward function is constructed in such a way that the expectation value of the reward (the expectation over the client's probabilistic computing) is maximum when the server's message is the correct solution to the problem.

To design high-fidelity quantum gates and large-scale quantum computers, effectively suppressing crosstalk is becoming increasingly important. Previous approaches to mitigate crosstalk rely on either hardware strategies, which are only applicable on limited platforms, or software techniques, which, however, cannot fully explore instruction parallelism. To address the above challenges, we propose a commutativity-based compile-time instruction reordering approach. We first propose a complete set of generalized commutativity rules for main types of quantum gates, and then we design a two-level bidirectional reordering algorithm to reorder gates according to these rules for effective crosstalk mitigation. Our approach can not only capture both forward and backward instruction correlations but also reduce the effect of decoherence. We evaluate our approach with 117 quantum programs.

In these logics well-formed formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information: possible pure states of quantum systems that can store the information in question. At the same time, the logical connectives are interpreted as quantum logical gates: unitary operators that process quantum information in a reversible way, giving rise to quantum circuits. Quantum computational logics have been mainly studied as sentential logics(whose alphabet consists of atomic sentences and of logical connectives). In this article we propose a semantic characterization for a first-order epistemic quantum computational logic, whose language can express sentences like Alice knows that everybody knows that she is pretty. One can prove that (unlike the case of logical connectives) both quantifiers and epistemic operators cannot be generally represented as (reversible) quantum logical gates. The act of knowing and the use of universal (or existential) assertions seem to involve some irreversible theoretic jumps, which are similar to quantum measurements. Since all epistemic agents are characterized by specific epistemic domains(which contain all pieces of information accessible to them), the unrealistic phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided: knowing a given sentence does not imply knowing all its logical consequences.

We introduce a framework starting from reconstructing the higher-resolution panchromatic image by using the subpixel-shifts between a set of lower-resolution images (registration), then interpolation, restoration, till using the higher-resolution image in pan-sharpening a multispectral image by weighted IHS+Wavelet fusion technique. For successful super-resolution, accurate image registration should be achieved by optimal estimation of subpixel-shifts. Optimal-parameters blind restoration and interpolation should be performed for the optimal quality higher-resolution image. There is a trade-off between spatial and spectral enhancement in image fusion; it is difficult for the existing methods to do the best in both aspects.

This research designs a novel distributed quantum electronic medical record system and suggests a new private quantum blockchain network based on security considerations.

The main purpose of this work is therefore aimed at addressing some of these limitations by introducing a new C++ processing backend for ProjectQ, as well as starting a complete rewrite of the simulator code already written in C++. The core of this work is centered around on a new C++ API for ProjectQ that moves most of the compiler processing into natively compiled code. We achieve this by providing a new compiler engine to perform the conversion from Python to C++, which ensures that we retain maximum compatibility with existing user code while providing significant speed-ups. We also introduce some of our work aimed at porting the existing C++ code to offload the more demanding calculations onto GPUs for better performance. We then investigate the performance of this new API by comparing it with the original ProjectQ implementation, as well as some other existing quantum computing frameworks. The preliminary results show that the C++ API is able to considerably reduce the cost of compilation, to the point that the compilation process becomes mostly limited by the performance of the simulator.

Separately, Aaronson conjectured that there exists an oracle O such that BQP(O) not equal (BPPBQNC)(O). These conjectures are intriguing allusions to the unresolved potential of combining classical and low-depth quantum computation. In this work we show that the Welded Tree Problem, which is an oracle problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time as shown by Childs et al. (arXiv:quant-ph/0209131), cannot be solved in BPPBQNC, nor can it be solved in the class that Jozsa describes. This proves Aaronson's oracle separation conjecture and provides a counterpoint to Jozsa's conjecture relative to the Welded Tree oracle problem. More precisely, we define two complexity classes, HQC and JC whose languages are decided by two different families of interleaved quantum-classical circuits. HQC contains BPPBQNC and is therefore relevant to Aaronson's conjecture, while JC captures the model of computation that Jozsa considers. We show that the Welded Tree Problem gives an oracle separation between either of {JC, HQC} and BQP.

Long-range interactions, however, prevent parallelism of interacting qubit pairs with their surrounding restriction zones. Therefore, the quantum program cannot be run directly on an NA quantum computer (NAQC) unless compiled. The recent compiling study of NAQC applies simple layer-by-layer scheduling and does not consider the difference in gate duration. To address the above issues, we focus on the qubit mapping and quantum gate scheduling (M&S) problem of quantum circuits to meet hardware constraints of superconductivity and even NAs. Our goal is to shorten the execution time to mitigate decoherence noise. We propose a block-game-like abstraction mechanism TETRIS which is an abstract model of the M&S problem and aware of the duration difference of gates and several other NA characteristics. Based on the abstraction, we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm (HGA) to solve the M&S problem efficiently. To further speed up the execution of the circuit, we embed HGA into a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework to solve the M&S problem, which consumes more compiling time but achieves a better result.

Intuitively, randomized encoding (f ) over cap of a function f is another function such that f(x) can be recovered from (f ) over cap (x), and nothing except for (f ) over cap (x) is leaked from (f ) over cap (x). Its quantum version, quantum randomized encoding, has been introduced recently [Brakerski and Yuen, arXiv:2006.010851. Intuitively, quantum randomized encoding (F ) over cap of a quantum operation F is another quantum operation such that, for any quantum state rho, F(rho) can be recovered from (f ) over cap(rho), and nothing except for F(rho) is leaked from (f ) over cap(rho). In this paper, we show three results. First, we show that if quantum randomized encoding of BB84 state generations is possible with an encoding operation E, then a two-round verification of quantum computing is possible with a classical verifier who can additionally do the operation E. One of the most important goals in the field of the verification of quantum computing is to construct a verification protocol with a verifier as classical as possible. This result therefore demonstrates a potential application of quantum randomized encoding to the verification of quantum computing: if we can find a good quantum randomized encoding (in terms of the encoding complexity), then we can construct a good verification protocol of quantum computing. Our second result is, however, to show that too good quantum randomized encoding is impossible: if quantum randomized encoding for the generation of even simple states (such as BB84 states) is possible with a classical encoding operation, then the no-cloning is violated. Finally, we consider a natural modification of blind quantum computing protocols in such a way that the server gets the output like quantum randomized encoding.

The scarcity of information on He@hydrates makes such complexes challenging targets, while their computational study entails an interesting and arduous task. Some of them have been synthesized in the laboratory, which motivates further investigations on their stability. Hence, the main focus is to examine the performance and accuracy of different wave function-based electronic structure methods, such as MP2, CCSD(T), their explicitly correlated (F12) and domain-based local pair-natural orbital (DLPNO) analogs, as well as modern and conventional density functional theory (DFT) approaches, and analytical model potentials available. Different structures are considered, starting from the simplest system formed by a noble gas atom (such as He) and one water molecule, followed by the study of the fundamental units present in all ice-like and dathrate-like frameworks (such as pentamers and hexamers) and finally the description of interactions in the building blocks of three-dimensional (3D) ice channels (e.g., horizontal and perpendicular ice II and I-h) and clathrate-like cages, such as the 5(12) present in the most common sI, sII, and sH dathrate-hydrate structures. The idea is to provide well-converged DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DFMP2/CBS reference datasets that in turn are used to validate how DFT functionals (in total, 29 approaches from generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, to hybrid and range-separated functionals, including dispersion correction treatments, were checked) and analytical semiempirical/ab initio-based potentials perform compared with high-level alternatives. Within all tested approaches, those best-performing were identified and classified. Most of the DFT/DFT-D functionals, as well as available analytical pairwise model potentials, face difficulties in describing both hydrogen-bonded water frameworks and dispersion bound He - water interactions. Including dispersion corrections yields an overall well-balanced performance for LC omega PBE-D3BJ and PBE0-D4 functionals.

In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing largescale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits.

Hydrogen energy has the advantage of low carbon dioxide emission and the ability to generate a lot of energy per weight. However, gaseous hydrogen has a low hydrogen storage density per unit volume, so a liquefaction process is required. Liquid hydrogen has a lower pressure than hydrogen in gaseous state, so the risk of explosion is low and transportation cost is reduced because it is easy to transport in large quantities. Therefore, the hydrogen liquefaction process is important and can improve energy efficiency. Specific Energy Consumption (SEC), commonly used as a performance indicator in the hydrogen liquefaction process, is the sum of energy consumed in the entire process to liquefy 1 kg of hydrogen. However, since the uncertainty of the attribute values lowers the accuracy of prediction, in order to overcome this issue, this study proposes a framework for predicting the SEC value according to the attribute value using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on quantum mechanics.

Specifically, quantum logic was introduced in 1936 by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann as a framework for capturing the logical peculiarities of quantum observables: in the 1D case it coincides with Boolean propositional logic but, starting with dimension two, violates the distributive law. We introduce the weak and strong satisfiability problem for quantum logic propositional formulae. It turns out that in dimension two, both are also NP-complete. For higher-dimensional spaces R-d and C-d with d >= 3 fixed, on the other hand, we show both problems to be complete for the nondeterministic Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) model of real computation. This provides a unified view on both Turing and real BSS complexity theory, and extends the (still relatively scarce) list of problems established NPR-complete with one, perhaps, closest in spirit to the classical Cook-Levin Theorem. More precisely, strong satisfiability of boolean AND boolean OR boolean AND-terms is complete, while that of boolean AND boolean OR-terms (i.e., those in conjunctive form) can be decided in polynomial time in dimensions d >= 2. The decidability of the infinite-dimensional case being still open, we proceed to investigate the case of indefinite finite dimensions. Here, weak satisfiability still belongs to NPR and strong satisfiability is still hard; the latter, in fact, turns out as polynomial-time equivalent to the feasibility of noncommutative integer polynomial equations over matrix rings.",76,6,6,0,11,0004-5411,1557-735X,,MAY,2016,10.1145/2869073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2869073,31,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,DL5PO,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

These perspectives require a physical system able to encode, process and store for a sufficiently long amount of time the quantum information. However, the optimal engineering of currently available quantum computers, which are small and flawed by several non-ideal phenomena, requires an efficacious methodology for exploring the design space. Hence, there is an unmet need for the development of reliable hardware-aware simulation infrastructures able to efficiently emulate the behaviour of quantum hardware that commits to looking for innovative systematic ways, with a bottom-up approach starting from the physical level, moving to the device level and up to the system level. This article discusses the development of a classical simulation infrastructure for semiconductor quantum-dot quantum computation based on compact models, where each device is described in terms of the main physical parameters affecting its performance in a sufficiently easy way from a computational point of view for providing accurate results without involving sophisticated physical simulators, thus reducing the requirements on CPU and memory. The effectiveness of the involved approximations is tested on a benchmark of quantum circuits - in the expected operating ranges of quantum hardware - by comparing the corresponding outcomes with those obtained via numeric integration of the Schrodinger equation.

Our study aims to establish a holistic hybrid quantum noise model to determine the quantum channel capacity. In this paper, we formulated a mathematical expression for this capacity and conducted simulations for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian inputs. A hybrid noise model is constructed by convolution of Poisson-distributed quantum noise with classical additive white Gaussian noise. We characterized the quantum-classical noise and the received signal using Gaussian Mixture Models. The maximum amount of quantum information that can be reliably transmitted over a quantum channel (per use of the channel) is determined by its capacity, and entropy and related quantities like mutual information play a role in calculating this capacity.

The set of quantum circuits that can be reliably run on NISQ devices is limited by their noisy operations and low qubit counts. This paper introduces CutQC, a scalable hybrid computing approach that combines classical computers and quantum computers to enable evaluation of quantum circuits that cannot be run on classical or quantum computers alone. CutQC cuts large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits, allowing them to be executed on smaller quantum devices. Classical postprocessing can then reconstruct the output of the original circuit. This approach offers significant runtime speedup compared with the only viable current alternative-purely classical simulations-and demonstrates evaluation of quantum circuits that are larger than the limit of QC or classical simulation. Furthermore, in real-system runs, CutQC achieves much higher quantum circuit evaluation fidelity using small prototype quantum computers than the state-of-the-art large NISQ devices achieve.

We argue that in many situations this semiclassical theory will be a close approximation to quantum field theory. In a more speculative argument, we discuss the possibility that the apparent quantization of the electromagnetic field could be a result of (1) quantization of interactions of the electromagnetic field with matter and (2) wave packets, regions within the electromagnetic field that are approximate photons.

The diagrammatic language is generated by two kinds of nodes: the so-called 'spider' associated with the computational basis, as well as a new arity-N generalisation of the Hadamard gate, which satisfies a variation of the spider fusion law. Unlike previous graphical calculi, this admits compact encodings of non-linear classical functions. For example, the AND gate can be depicted as a diagram of just 2 generators, compared to similar to 25 in the ZX-calculus. Consequently, N-controlled gates, hypergraph states, Hadamard+Toffoli circuits, and diagonal circuits at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy also enjoy encodings with low constant overhead. This suggests that this calculus will be significantly more convenient for reasoning about the interplay between classical non-linear behaviour (e.g. in an oracle) and purely quantum operations.

However, strictly speaking, the role of entanglement in this model of computation was not entirely clear.

The spin manipulation executes quantum computation ranging over all Hilbert space, which is achieved by sets of quantum gate operations, called universal gates. The bus electron spin quantum bits (qubits) interact extensively with other electron spins and relatively localized nuclear spins as client qubits. Since the electron spins play the central role in MSQCs, MSQCs can simply be regarded as ESR-QCs. Generally compared with NMR-QC, ESR-QCs have advantages in fast gate operations, global control in client qubits, and initialization process. On the other hand, apparent disadvantages are fast decoherence and technical difficulties in current spin manipulation technology. In this chapter, we introduce the implementation of an adiabatic quantum computation from the theoretical point of view. The main issue is quantum operations in realistic Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs) based on molecular spin systems, suggesting that the established experimental schemes and protocols render MSQCs realistic. For this purpose, an algorithm is selected for an adiabatic factorization problem of 21, as we compare with the comparable algorithm of NMR experiments with three nuclear qubits. Toward adiabatic quantum computation on MSQCs, two molecular spin systems are selected: One is a molecular spin composed of three exchange/dipole-coupled electrons as electron-only spin qubits and the other an electron-bus qubit with two client nuclear spin qubits. Their electronic spin structures are well characterized particularly in terms of quantum mechanical behavior as interpreted by their spin Hamiltonians. The implementation of AQC has been achieved by establishing ESR/MR pulse sequences applied to the spin Hamiltonians in a fully controlled manner of spin manipulation. The conquered pulse sequences have been compared with the NMR-QC experiments and standard QCs. A significant result is that MSQCs can perform adiabatic quantum computations efficiently as same as standard QCs, and the computations can be performed in ESR timescale even if the client nuclear spin qubits participate in the computation processes.",54,2,4,0,11,0192-6020,,978-1-4939-3658-8; 978-1-4939-3656-4,,2016,10.1007/978-1-4939-3658-8_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3658-8_4,40,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Physics, Applied",Computer Science; Physics,BI5EI,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we consider delegation schemes for quantum circuits, where we try to minimize the quantum operations needed by the client. We construct a new scheme for delegating a large circuit family, which we call C+P circuits. C+P circuits are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates and diagonal gates. Our scheme is non-interactive, requires small amount of quantum computation from the client (proportional to input length but independent of the circuit size), and can be proved secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional assumptions, such as the existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice the random oracle can be replaced by an appropriate hash function or block cipher, for example, SHA-3, AES. This protocol allows a client to delegate the most expensive part of some quantum algorithms, for example, Shor's algorithm. The previous protocols that are powerful enough to delegate Shor's algorithm require either many client side quantum operations or the existence of FHE. The protocol requires asymptotically fewer quantum gates on the client side compared to running Shor's algorithm locally. To hide the inputs, our scheme uses an encoding that maps one input qubit to multiple qubits. We then provide a novel generalization of classical garbled circuits (reversible garbled circuits) to allow the computation of Toffoli circuits on this encoding.

QC offers a powerful stage for solving complex and compound problems like searching and number factoring. A critical task in utilizing quantum physics in many application fields is circuit design using reversible quantum gates. Unitary decomposition is a popular scheme for mapping quantum algorithms to any set of elementary quantum operations. Using decomposition techniques enables transformation of unitary matrices into fundamental quantum gates, which is critical for running algorithms on prevailing quantum computers. Any 3x3 reversible quantum gate can be decomposed into single-qubit rotation gates and two qubit CNOT gates.

To effectively allocate computing resources to components in these systems, real-time component-based scheduling theory has been studied from various perspectives. The main advantage of component-based scheduling theory is that it guarantees the schedulability of an independent component and composability of multiple components. However, the existing component scheduling theory cannot be directly applied to real hardware platform due to an impractical assumption that resource allocation must be conducted across the continuum of real numbers, whereas actual operating systems (or virtualization systems) allocate resources in units of scheduling time quantum.

Improvements in the performance of side-channel attacks are of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a framework to be used in key-recovery side-channel attacks on CCA-secure post-quantum encryption schemes. The basic idea is to construct chosen ciphertext queries to a plaintext checking oracle that collects information on a set of secret variables in a single query. Then a large number of such queries is considered, each related to a different set of secret variables, and they are modeled as a low-density parity-check code (LDPC code). Secret variables are finally determined through efficient iterative decoding methods, such as belief propagation, using soft information. The utilization of LDPC codes offers efficient decoding, source coding, and error correction benefits. It has been demonstrated that this approach provides significant improvements compared to previous work by reducing the required number of queries, such as the number of traces in a power attack. The framework is demonstrated and implemented in two different cases. On one hand, we attack implementations of HQC in a timing attack, lowering the number of required traces considerably compared to attacks in previous work. On the other hand, we describe and implement a full attack on a masked implementation of Kyber using power analysis. Using the ChipWhisperer evaluation platform, our real-world attacks recover the long-term secret key of a first-order masked implementation of Kyber-768 with an average of only 12 power traces.",47,0,0,0,0,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-981-99-8729-0; 978-981-99-8730-6,,2023,10.1007/978-981-99-8730-6_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-8730-6_7,34,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BW4ZR,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous approaches to suppressing ZZ crosstalk have mainly relied on specific chip design that can complicate chip fabrication and aggravate decoherence. To some extent, special chip design can be avoided by relying on pulse optimization to suppress ZZ crosstalk. However, existing approaches are non-scalable, as their required time and memory grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved. To address the above problems, we propose a scalable approach by co-optimizing pulses and scheduling. We optimize pulses to offer an ability to suppress ZZ crosstalk surrounding a gate, and then design scheduling strategies to exploit this ability and achieve suppression across the whole circuit. A main advantage of such co-optimization is that it does not require special hardware support. Besides, we implement our approach as a general framework that is compatible with different pulse optimization methods. We have conducted extensive evaluations by simulation and on a real quantum computer. Simulation results show that our proposal can improve the fidelity of quantum computing on 4 similar to 12 qubits by up to 81x (11x on average).

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesizer explores a larger solution space, thus is optimal in a stronger sense. In addition, it reduces time and space complexity exponentially compared to some leading optimal approaches. The key to this success is a more efficient spacetime-based variable encoding of the layout synthesis problem as a mathematical programming problem. By slightly changing our formulation, we arrive at an approximate synthesizer that is even more efficient and outperforms some leading heuristic approaches, in terms of additional gate cost, by up to 100%, and also fidelity by up to 10x on a comprehensive set of benchmark programs and architectures. For a specific family of quantum programs named QAOA, which is deemed to be a promising application for near-term quantum computers, we further adjust the approximate synthesizer by taking commutation into consideration, achieving up to 75% reduction in depth and up to 65% reduction in additional cost compared to the tool used in a leading QAOA study.",28,48,54,2,3,1933-7760,,978-1-6654-2324-3,,2020,10.1145/3400302.3415620,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3400302.3415620,9,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BR8DW,"Green Submitted, Bronze",2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this spirit, we design a method to boost the computational power of near-term quantum computers by adapting protocols used in quantum error correction to implement Approximate Quantum Error Correction (AQEC). By approximating fully-fledged error correction mechanisms, we can increase the compute volume (qubits x gates, or Simple Quantum Volume (SQV)) of near-term machines. The crux of our design is a fast hardware decoder that can approximately decode detected error syndromes rapidly. Specifically, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that approximate error decoding can be accomplished online in near-term quantum systems by designing and implementing a novel algorithm in superconducting Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic technology. This avoids a critical decoding backlog, hidden in all offline decoding schemes, that leads to idle time exponential in the number of T gates in a program [58]. Our design utilizes one SFQ processing module per physical quantum bit. Employing state-of-the-art SFQ synthesis tools, we show that the circuit area, power, and latency are within the constraints of typical, contemporary quantum system designs. Under a pure dephasing error model, the proposed accelerator and AQEC solution is able to expand SQV by factors between 3,402 and 11,163 on expected near-term machines. The decoder achieves a 5% accuracy threshold as well as pseudo-thresholds of approximately 5%, 4.75%, 4.5%, and 3.5% physical error rates for code distances 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. Decoding solutions are achieved in a maximum of similar to 20 nanoseconds on the largest code distances studied.

Instead, we implemented a real-time therom field dynamics formalism, which has the added benefit of being able to compute quantities that are both time- and temperature-dependent. To implement thermo field dynamics we apply a unitary transformation [1] to discrete quantum mechanical operators to make new Hamiltonians with encoded temperature dependence. The method works normally for fermions, which have a finite representation, but needs some modification to work with bosons. These Hamiltonians are then processed into a Pauli matrix representation in order to be used as input for IBM's Qiskit package [2].

Many approaches have been devised to increase the performance of the computers. One such way is to reduce the size of the transistors used in the systems. Another very significant tactic is to use quantum computers. It proved to be very effective when used to factor large numbers. It was found that it could decrypt codes in 20 minutes which took billions of years with classical computers. This was a great motivation for focusing on this topic. A quantum computer allows a 'quantum bit' or qubit to have three states - 0, 1, and 0 or 1. The last state is the coherent state. This enables an operation to be performed on two diverse values at the same time. However, this brings out a problem of decoherence. It becomes difficult to perform the computation using quantum computers. A quantum computer is desired to have five capabilities - scalable system, initializable state, long decoherence time, universal set of quantum gates, high efficiency measurements. Architecture of the quantum computer is the new research area. It is affected by quantum arithmetic, error management, and cluster-state computing. Without it, the quantum algorithms would not prove to be as efficient. To fully utilize the power of a quantum computer, the algorithms used should be based on quantum parallelism.

Quantum telecloning is a protocol that originates from a combination of quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. Here we present 1 -> 2 and 1 -> 3 quantum telecloning circuits, with and without ancilla, that are theoretically optimal (meaning the clones have the highest fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics), universal (meaning the clone fidelity is independent of the state being cloned), and symmetric (meaning the clones all have the same fidelity). We implement these circuits on gate model IBMQ and Quantinuum NISQ hardware and quantify the clone fidelities using parallel single qubit state tomography. Quantum telecloning using mid-circuit measurement with classical feedforward control (i.e. real time if statements) is demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-2 device. Two alternative implementations of quantum telecloning, deferred measurement and post selection, are demonstrated on ibmq_montreal, where mid-circuit measurements with real time if statements are not available.

Unfortunately, physical quantum devices are highly susceptible to errors that limit us from running most of these quantum applications. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are required to implement Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQC) on which computations can be performed without encountering errors. Error decoding is a critical component of quantum error correction and is responsible for transforming a set of qubit measurements generated by the QEC code, called the syndrome, into error locations and error types. For the feasibility of implementation, error decoders must not only identify errors with high accuracy, but also be fast and scalable to a large number of qubits. Unfortunately, most of the prior works on error decoding have focused primarily only on the accuracy and have relied on software implementations that are too slow to be of practical use. Furthermore, these studies only look at designing a single decoder and do not analyze the challenges involved in scaling the storage and bandwidth requirements when performing error correction in large systems with thousands of qubits. In this paper, we present AFS, an accurate, fast, and scalable decoder architecture that is designed to operate in the context of systems with hundreds of logical qubits. We present the hardware implementation of AFS, which is based on the Union Find decoding algorithm and employs a three-stage pipelined design. AFS provides orders of magnitude higher accuracy compared to recent SFQ-based hardware decoders (logical error rate of 6 x 10(-10) for physical error rate of 10(-3)) and low decoding latency (42ns on average), while being robust to measurement errors introduced while extracting syndromes during the QEC cycles. We also reduce the amount of decoding hardware required to perform QEC simultaneously on all the logical qubits by co-designing the micro-architecture across multiple decoding units. Our proposed Conjoined-Decoder Architecture (CDA) reduces the storage overhead by 70% (10MB to 2.8MB). Finally, we reduce the bandwidth overheads required to transmit syndromes from the qubits to the decoders by exploiting the sparsity in the syndromes and compressing the data.

Although much work has been done on establishing error correcting codes to address issues of decoherence, and schemes can be utilized to leverage quantum effects for the sake of intrusion detection over quantum communication channels, there is a lack of literature in the field regarding side-channel attacks on transpiled quantum circuits, particularly those which leverage quantum effects to gather information about quantum circuits running in the cloud. We explored issues of decoherence by examining quantum circuit behavior both before and after a specified circuit was executed in order to ascertain decalibration rates and potential sources of decoherence: our data clearly shows that information on an interim circuit can be acquired in this manner. Using convenient data classification techniques and various circuit diagrams consisting of one quantum gate and several measurements, we were able to distinguish between these various circuits when executed at position n in the interim phase by training our classifier on data from probing circuits executed at queue positions n-1 and n+1. This shows that there is sufficient information residing in the data before and after a circuit is executed on a cloud-based superconducting quantum computer to allow an attacker to ascertain information about an otherwise unknown third-party circuit and shows potential to form the basis of a side-channel attack in cases where queue positions can be examined to target a third party's transpiled circuit during experimentation.

The components of quantum coprocessors are called qubits. Their behavior should be described by a wave function. In particular, qubits can be discrete objects - finite states machines. Such qubits will be called digital. Quantum coprocessors and quantum computers built on their basis will also be called digital. External influences on digital qubits are fed through digital quantum gates. So a digital qubit is a unique chain of digital quantum gates. Digital quantum coprocessor can be implemented in FPGA as several chains of digital quantum. The article explores FPGA-based digital quantum coprocessor. It consists of 32 qubits. The structures of digital quantum gates, digital qubits, and a digital quantum coprocessor capable of performing the quantum Fourier transform are presented. Digital qubits were implemented for the case of real amplitudes of the wave functions. The results of the quantum Fourier transform of a 32-qubit digital quantum coprocessor implemented on one FPGA are presented. The execution time of one quantum Fourier transform does not depend on the number of qubits in the digital quantum coprocessor and is commensurate with the time of electron spin change (near 10 ns).

However, the state-of-the-art Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers still do not have enough qubits to accommodate the error correction circuit. Noise in quantum gates limits the reliability of quantum circuits. To characterize the noise effects, prior methods such as process tomography, gateset tomography and randomized benchmarking have been proposed. However, the challenge is that these methods do not scale well with the number of qubits. Noise models based on the understanding of underneath physics have also been proposed to study different kinds of noise in quantum computers. The difficulty is that there is no widely accepted noise model that incorporates all different kinds of errors. The real-world errors can be very complicated and it remains an active area of research to produce accurate noise models. In this paper, instead of using noise models to estimate the reliability, which is measured with success rates or inference strength, we treat the NISQ quantum computer as a black box. We use several quantum circuit characteristics such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, the number of CNOT gates, and the connection topology of the quantum computer as inputs to the black box and derive a reliability estimation model using (1) polynomial fitting and (2) a shallow neural network. We propose randomized benchmarks with random numbers of qubits and basic gates to generate a large data set for neural network training. We show that the estimated reliability from our black-box model outperforms the noise models from Qiskit.

An introductory description of the mathematical models of a qubit and quantum information processing operations and projective measurement is presented as background. Discussions of quantum error sources and associated fault models are included using the concepts and notation explained in the background section.

It stands between computer architecture and mathematics, as it relies strongly on variants of abstract interpretation. One of the features that causes the largest uncertainty regarding WCET evaluation for low-level analysis of sequential execution on a single processor is taking Cache Memory-related Delays (CMRD) and Cache-related Preemption Delays (CRPD) correctly into account. Research work from the 1990s provides a good basic framework for this problem as long as a task runs without preemption. But when preemption of tasks is allowed, although several formalisms exist, their predictive power is lower and the usual approach relies on analyses of NP-hard problems. In this article, we want to show some potential advantages of using a formalism inspired by Quantum Computing (QC) to evaluate CMRDs with preemptions while avoiding the NP-hard problem underneath. The experimental results, with a classic (non-quantum) numerical approach, on a selection of Malardalen benchmark programs display very good accuracy, while the complexity of the evaluation is a low-order polynomial of the number of memory accesses.

The proposed quantum-inspired evolutionary computation is more flexible in constructing diverse solutions than the classical synthesis method. The entangled local search mechanism further enhances the ability to discover the optimal solutions on an efficient frontier. The encoding can be slightly changed to achieve various gate libraries circuit synthesis in the quantum or reversible Boolean circuits. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can be more effective in composing a compact quantum circuit than the state-of-the-art method.

But usual materials are 3D objects which can admit more complicated topologies.

The efforts by companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft to construct quantum computers have been making headlines for years. Equally important is the challenge of translating problems into a state that can be fed to these machines. Because quantum computers are in essence controllable quantum systems, the problems that most naturally map to them are those of quantum mechanics. Quantum chemistry has seen particular success in the form of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, which is used to determine the ground state energy of molecular systems. The goal of our work has been to use the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics to translate other systems so that they can be run through this same algorithm. We describe two ways of accomplishing this using a position basis approach and a Gaussian basis approach. We use this translation to compute finite temperature quantities such as the average energy as a function of temperature. We do this by constructing a 0+1-dimensional thermal field theory, constructing a thermal double of the system and using tensor products to construct operators in the system coupled to a heat bath. We also discuss how to include a chemical potential in the quantum computations. We then connect the 0+1 formalism to gauge theory by using an effective matrix model description used in nuclear theory. We study effective potentials for components of the gauge field and use the VQE algorithm to calculate the ground state energies.

However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e., graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present. In this paper, we revisit the basics of quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as graph-based).

This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [1], [2], [3]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of the time complexity of server-side quantum computations (which typically dominate the total time complexity of both the client and the server), the fastest singleserver CVQC protocol so far has complexity O(poly(kappa)|C|(3)) where |C| is the size of the circuit to be verified and kappa is the security parameter, given by Mahadev [4]. This leads to a similar cubic time blowup in many existing protocols including multiparty quantum computation, zero knowledge and obfuscation [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Considering the preciousness of quantum computation resources, this cubic complexity barrier could be a big obstacle for theoretical and practical development of protocols for these problems. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity O(poly(kappa)|C|) (in terms of the total time complexity of both the client and the server), which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [11] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [12], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography.

This paper studies a notion of MPC that allows some classical and some quantum parties to securely compute a quantum functionality over their joint private inputs. In particular, we construct constant-round composable protocols for blind and verifiable classical delegation of quantum computation, and give applications to secure quantum computation with classical communication. Assuming QLWE (the quantum hardness of learning with errors), we obtain the following (maliciously-secure) protocols for computing any BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial-time) functionality. - A six-round protocol between one quantum server and multiple classical clients in the CRS (common random string) model. - A three-round protocol between one quantum server and multiple classical clients in the PKI (public-key infrastructure) + QRO (quantum random oracle) model. - A two-message protocol between quantum sender and classical receiver (a quantum non-interactive secure computation protocol), in the QRO model. To enable composability of classical verification of quantum computation, we require the notion of malicious blindness, which stipulates that the prover does not learn anything about the verifier's delegated computation, even if it is able to observe whether or not the verifier accepted the proof. To construct a protocol with malicious blindness, we use a classical verification protocol for sampBQP computation (Chung et al., Arxiv 2020), which in general has inverse polynomial soundness error, to prove honest evaluation of QFHE (quantum fully-homomorphic encryption) ciphertexts with negligible soundness error. Obtaining a constant-round protocol requires a strong parallel repetition theorem for classical verification of quantum computation, which we show following the nearly orthogonal projector proof strategy (Alagic et al., TCC 2020).",48,2,2,1,2,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-90459-3; 978-3-030-90458-6,,2021,10.1007/978-3-030-90459-3_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-90459-3_1,30,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BS5UR,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, due to the mathematics and physics perspective through which quantum computing is traditionally presented, most resources are inaccessible to many undergraduate students, let alone the general public. It is thus imperative to develop resources and best-practices for quantum computing instruction accessible to students at all levels. In this paper, we describe the development and results of our Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Introduction to Quantum Computing for Everyone. This course presents an introduction to quantum computing with few technical prerequisites. In the first half of the course, quantum computing concepts are introduced with a unique, purely visual representation, allowing students to develop conceptual understanding without the burden of learning new mathematical notation. In the second half, students are taught the formal notation for concepts and objects already introduced, reinforcing student understanding of these concepts and providing an applicable context for the technical material.

Surprisingly, the basic mathematical structures of gate-based quantum computing, such as unitary operations on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, are not unique to quantum systems but may be found in certain classical systems as well. Previously, it has been shown that one can represent an arbitrary multi-qubit quantum state in terms of classical analog signals using nested quadrature amplitude modulated signals. Furthermore, using digitally controlled analog electronics one may manipulate these signals to perform quantum gate operations and thereby execute quantum algorithms. The computational capacity of a single signal is, however, limited by the required bandwidth, which scales exponentially with the number of qubits when represented using frequency-based encoding. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a method to extend this approach to multiple parallel signals. Doing so allows a larger quantum state to be emulated with the same gate time required for processing frequency-encoded signals. In the proposed representation, each doubling of the number of signals corresponds to an additional qubit in the spatial domain. Single quit gate operations are similarly extended so as to operate on qubits represented using either frequency-based or spatial encoding schemes. Furthermore, we describe a method to perform gate operations between pairs of qubits represented using frequency or spatial encoding or between frequency-based and spatially encoded qubits. Finally, we describe how this approach may be extended to represent qubits in the time domain as well.",24,1,1,0,0,,,978-1-5386-9170-0,,2018,,,9,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BM7HG,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sels et al. identify a promising application for such a quantum-classic hybrid approach, namely inferring molecular structure from NMR spectra, by employing a range of machine learning tools in combination with a quantum simulator. Recent technological advances may lead to the development of small-scale quantum computers that are capable of solving problems that cannot be tackled with classical computers. A limited number of algorithms have been proposed and their relevance to real-world problems is a subject of active investigation. Analysis of many-body quantum systems is particularly challenging for classical computers due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles. Hence, solving the problems relevant to chemistry and condensed-matter physics is expected to be the first successful application of quantum computers. In this Article, we propose another class of problems from the quantum realm that can be solved efficiently on quantum computers: model inference for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is important for biological and medical research. Our results are based on three interconnected studies. First, we use methods from classical machine learning to analyse a dataset of NMR spectra of small molecules. We perform stochastic neighbourhood embedding and identify clusters of spectra, and demonstrate that these clusters are correlated with the covalent structure of the molecules.

Contextuality-the denial of a notion of classical physical reality-has emerged as a promising hypothesis: e.g. Howard et al. showed that the magic states needed to practically achieve quantum computation are contextual. Strong contextuality, as defined by Abramsky-Brandenburger, is an extremal form of contextuality describing systems that exhibit logically paradoxical behaviour. After introducing number-theoretic techniques for constructing exotic quantum paradoxes, we present large families of strongly contextual magic states that are computationally optimal in the sense that they enable universal quantum computation via deterministic injection of gates of the Clifford hierarchy.

Although QFIE offers the possibility of performing efficient fuzzy computation on quantum computers, its real-world applicability is limited by the high levels of noise still present in current quantum computers. Consequently, it is necessary to introduce technological arrangements to make QFIE fully functional in practical cases until noisefree quantum computers are released.

QuPAA provides a series of mechanisms, including parallelism exploitation, microcode streaming, and a quantum flexible instruction set (QuFIS).

In this paper, a multi-client universal circuit-based full-blind quantum computation (FBQC) model is proposed. In order to meet the requirements of multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data, all clients with limited quantum ability outsource the key generation to a trusted key center and upload their encrypted data to the data center. Considering the feasibility of physical implementation, all quantum gates in the circuit are replaced with the combination of pi/8 rotation operator set {R-z(pi/4), Ry(pi/4), CRz(pi/4), CRy(pi/4), CCRz(pi/4), CCRy(pi/4)}. In addition, the data center is only allowed to perform one pi/8 rotation operator each time, but does not know the structure of the circuit (i.e., quantum computation), so it can guarantee the blindness of computation. Then, through combining this multi-client FBQC model and Grover searching algorithm, we continue to propose a quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud data. It solves the problem of multi-client access mode under searchable encryption in the cloud environment, and has the ability to resist against some quantum attacks. To better demonstrate our scheme, an example of our scheme to search on encrypted 2-qubit state is given in detail. Furthermore, the security of our scheme is analysed from two aspects: external attacks and internal attacks, and the result indicates that it can resist against such kinds of attacks and also guarantee the blindness of data and computation.",52,4,4,2,17,2169-3536,,,,2019,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960592,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960592,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NC0CQ,"gold, Green Submitted",2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead in Q(logn) must necessarily be incurred when running quantum circuits with n qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree, but that such a logarithmic depth overhead is achievable. The latter is shown by the construction of a 4-regular qubit interaction graph and associated compilation algorithm that can execute any quantum circuit with only a logarithmic depth overhead.",20,2,2,0,3,1533-7146,,,AUG,2020,,,20,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology; Physics, Particles & Fields; Physics, Mathematical",Computer Science; Physics,NN2LM,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantum physics suggests applications to-ward quantum computing. Swarms' self-organization leads to robotic swarm developments. Here, quantum computing is applied to swarm robotics. We model local interactions with a quantum circuit, testing it on simulators and quantum computers. To relate local with global behavior, we develop a block matrix-based model. Diagonal sub-matrices contain information on single robots; off-diagonal sub-matrices are the pairwise interaction terms. Comparing different swarms means comparing different block matrices. Choosing initial values and computation rules for off-diagonal blocks (with a particular logic gate), different behaviors can be modeled. To show the global-behavior emergence, we propose a specific pairwise-interaction logic gate, embedding the corresponding quantum circuit in an ant-foraging-inspired algorithm. To implement a first application, we choose the foraging-ant behavior for its clarity and importance in nature, running experiments with toy swarms (3 and 10 robots). We consider ants' individual and collective back-and-forth movements between the nest and the food source, analyzing the effect of entanglement.

Our main result is that for certain fundamental network problems such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and shortest paths, quantum communication does not help in substantially speeding up distributed algorithms for these problems compared to the classical setting. In order to obtain this result, we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al. [SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial lower bounds for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact and approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are new even in the classical setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification, answering an open problem of Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio, matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the Server model and Quantum Simulation Theorem which together provide a connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The Server model is the standard twoparty communication complexity model augmented with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is carried over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this hardness further to quantum distributed computing. Our techniques, except the proof of the hardness in the Server model, require very little knowledge in quantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving bounds on quantum distributed algorithms. In particular, if one can prove a lower bound for distributed algorithms for a certain problem using the technique of Das Sarma et al., it is likely that such lower bound can be extended to the quantum setting using tools provided in this paper and without the need of knowledge in quantum computing.",62,23,24,0,3,,,978-1-4503-2944-6,,2014,10.1145/2611462.2611488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2611462.2611488,10,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BP9MZ,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, the code suggests using random encoding with little structures to disperse the effect of attacks. We find that the decoding process can be modeled as a computing trap if the group spatial channel features are employed. The security problem is, therefore, transformed as random computing with redundancy. We employ a quantum algorithm to learn the computing trap model such that the computing redundancy can be removed quickly while the dispersed attack can be eliminated. In this respect, we can prove the existence of the quantum black-box model corresponding to the computing trap, and derive a precise expression of computing performance. Based on the result, we can formulate novel analytical closed-form expressions of system failure probability to characterize the reliability of the URLLC.

However, problems need to be solved in the practical use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. Broadbent et al. proposed running error correction over blind quantum computation, and Morimae and Fujii proposed using fault-tolerant entangled qubits as the resource for blind quantum computation. Both approaches impose severe demands on the teleportation channel, the former requiring unrealistic data rates and the latter near-perfect fidelity. To extend the application range of blind quantum computation, we suggest that Alice send input qubits encoded with error correction code instead of single input qubits. Two fault-tolerant protocols are presented and we showed the trade-off of the computational overhead using the ten-bit quantum carry-lookahead adder as an example.

A primary challenge is classical-to-quantum (C2Q) data encoding, which requires specific circuits for quantum state initialization, particularly for I/O intensive applications. The required state initialization circuits are often complex, and violate decoherence constraints. Another critical challenge for quantum computers is quantum state readout or quantum-to-classical (Q2C) data decoding. The general approach for Q2C involves repeated sampling of the quantum circuit, which often incurs significant overhead in the overall execution time. In this paper, we propose time-efficient methods for C2Q data encoding and Q2C data decoding for quantum algorithms. Decoherence optimized circuits for C2Q data encoding are presented along with analysis of their circuit depths. For Q2C, a novel approach based on more efficient sampling of the output state using the Quantum Wavelet Transform is proposed. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated on a state-of-the-art quantum computing device from IBM Quantum using realistic multi-spectral data. Experimental results are consistent with our theoretical expectations and confirm the efficiency of our proposed methods compared to existing techniques. More specifically, our proposed C2Q method demonstrates a theoretical 2x reduction in circuit depth which resulted in improving the experimental execution time compared to the state-of-the-art, while our Q2C method achieved a maximum of 89% reduction in circuit sampling time.",13,1,1,0,0,,,978-1-6654-9113-6,,2022,10.1109/QCE53715.2022.00110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QCE53715.2022.00110,4,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology",Computer Science; Physics,BU3QX,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

This scientific direction is currently relevant, since it is related to the problem of security and data protection in current information and communication networks. The article is devoted to quantum cryptography; it describes the development of quantum protocols as quantum key distribution systems. Grounded on the laws of quantum mechanics, the elaboration of modifications of secure data transfer protocols is shown. The authors considered the best-known protocol to be BB84 of quantum key distribution; a more modern modification of this protocol is BB84 Info-Z. Comparative analysis of these has also been carried out. It has been established that the BB84-Info-Z quantum protocol works more efficiently than BB84 since its lower error threshold allows the interceptor to obtain much less information about the secret key. The authors put forward a new idea to improve the BB84 protocol (which has been quite outdated for almost 40 years), due to the increase in modern requirements for quantum cryptography protocols. The modification is called CSLOE-2022. It enables significant intensification of cryptographic strength and the entanglement degree of the interceptor (cryptanalyst), which greatly complicates the very possibility of intercepting information. The ultimate goal of the CSLOE-2022 modification is to complicate the eavesdropping process so much that it can be considered completely useless for an attacker in terms of wasting time and resources. The modification allows exceeding the known speed limit of key generation without repeaters since it uses two sources, the phases of which, in addition to the hundreds of kilometers of fiber between them, are very difficult to stabilize. Comparison of the protocols by working distance showed that for BB84, this distance does not exceed 70 km; for BB84-Info-Z it is similar, at no more than 70 km, and the modification of CSLOE-2022 proposed by the authors theoretically allows increasing the working distance of the quantum protocol to 511 km (7.3 times).",47,1,1,0,2,,2079-9292,,DEC,2022,10.3390/electronics11233954,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11233954,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,9D9HZ,gold,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

These shortcomings result in suboptimal QCNN performance. Meanwhile, building quantum machines with enough qubits is technically difficult and costly. These obstacles motivate us to design a quantum edge computing (QEC) system capable of achieving the scalability of QCNNs. Quantum machines are organized hierarchically in the QEC system. The quantum machines closer to the users collaboratively load and extract quantum features from the high-dimensional input data. Subsequently, the quantum machine in the next layer collects the extracted features and performs further operations to produce the final results.

With the recent effort towards the large-scale quantum computer, architects have revealed various scalability issues including the constraints in a quantum control processor, which should be holistically analyzed to design a future scalable control processor. However, it has been impossible to identify and resolve the processor's scalability bottleneck due to the absence of a reliable tool to explore an extensive design space including microarchitecture, device technology, and operating temperature. In this paper, we present XQsim, an open-source cross-technology quantum control processor simulator. XQsim can accurately analyze the target control processors' scalability bottlenecks for various device technology and operating temperature candidates. To achieve the goal, we first fully implement a convincing control processor microarchitecture for the Fault-tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC) systems. Next, on top of the microarchitecture, we develop an architecture-level control processor simulator (XQsim) and thoroughly validate it with post-layout analysis, timing-accurate RTL simulation, and noisy quantum simulation. Lastly, driven by XQsim, we provide the future directions to design a 10+K qubit quantum control processor with several design guidelines and architecture optimizations.

The client's goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical - it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter kappa, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of kappa, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of kappa. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.",22,2,3,2,2,0737-8017,,978-1-4503-8053-9,,2021,10.1145/3406325.3451082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3406325.3451082,14,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics,BT2LN,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The player is provided a quantum circuit which they have to map to MBQC using polyominos. Polyominos, the building blocks of our game, consist of square tiles joined edge-to-edge to form different shapes. Each tile represents a measurement basis, differentiated by its color. Polyominos rest on a square-grid playing board, which signifies a cluster state. We show that mapping a quantum circuit to MBQC is equivalent to arranging a set of polyominos-each corresponding to a gate in the circuit-on the playing board, subject to certain rules. We state the rules in simple terms with no reference to quantum computing. One such rule describes ways to deform a polyomino while it still correctly realizes a given quantum gate. The player has to place polyominos on the playing board conforming to the rules. Any correct solution creates a valid realization of the quantum circuit in MBQC.

Current approaches such as the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) method can accumulate large errors and the associated quantum circuits are difficult to optimize. A recent method based on the Feynmann-Kitaev formalism of quantum dynamics has been put forth, where the full evolution of the system can be retrieved after a single optimization of an appropriate cost function.

However, it is becoming a more challenging issue for SaaS providers to meet user's Quality of Service (QoS) Parameter and maximize profit from cloud infrastructure. This proposed work satisfies both the user and the service provider by fulfilling service level agreement (SLA), user's QoS requirement, and increasing profit with efficient resources utilization. This paper proposes an Improved Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm (IQSSA), which improves the Salp Swarm algorithm by incorporating the principles of Quantum computing to increase the convergence rate. Further, Quantum-inspired Salp Swarm Grey Wolf Algorithm (QSSGWA) embeds SSA with Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to improve the global optimum solution, and quantum operator is used to initializing population. Proposed algorithms execute tasks under the user-defined deadline and budget constraints. Furthermore, the penalty cost is formulated and applied in the case of a deadline violation. IQSSA and QSSGWA are tested on 19 global benchmark functions, and results prove their superior performance compared to SSA, GWO, BAT, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, these algorithms are simulated on CloudSim, and performance matrices such as service provider's profit, makespan, SLA violation rate, task rejection rate, throughput, resource utilization, and response time are compared. The comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms offer better performance and more efficient scheduling than existing metaheuristics. Furthermore, simulation results clearly show that QSSGWA gives the best results for all performance matrices.

To lower the barrier, hybrid algorithms combining classical and quantum computers are used, where quantum computing is only used for those parts of computation that cannot be solved efficiently otherwise. In this paper, we tackle the multiple query optimization problem (MQO), an important NP-hard problem in database research. We present an implementation based on a scheme called quantum approximate optimization algorithm to solve the MQO on a gate-based quantum computer. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our implementation and compare its performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer - another type of quantum computer. Our implementation shows a qubit efficiency of close to 99%, which is almost a factor of 2 higher than the state-of-the-art implementation.

Without the burden of local data storage and maintenance, users can enjoy on-demand high quality cloud storage services. Recently, lattice-based cryptography has been considered as the best choice for post-quantum cryptography, which can resist quantum computer attacks. Considering the forthcoming of the quantum computer in the near future, in this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based cloud storage public auditing scheme, which is constructed based on lattice. We prove our scheme can guarantee public verifiability, unforgeability. Moreover, our scheme can prevent the third party auditor ( TPA) from revealing the primitive data blocks of cloud users.

Since the dimension of the state space grows exponentially with the number of qubits, we can easily reach situations where we pay less than a single quantum gate per data point for data-processing instructions, which would be rather expensive in classical computing. Formulating such instructions in terms of quantum gates, however, still remains a challenging task. Laying out the foundational functions for more advanced data-processing is therefore a subject of paramount importance for advancing the realm of quantum computing. In this paper, we introduce the formalism of encoding so called-semi-boolean polynomials. As it turns out, arithmetic Z/2(n)Z ring operations can be formulated as semi-boolean polynomial evaluations, which allows convenient generation of unsigned integer arithmetic quantum circuits. For arithmetic evaluations, the resulting algorithm has been known as Fourier-arithmetic. We extend this type of algorithm with additional features, such as ancilla-free in-place multiplication and integer coefficient polynomial evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a tailor-made method for encoding signed integers succeeded by an encoding for arbitrary floating-point numbers. This representation of floating-point numbers and their processing can be applied to any quantum algorithm that performs unsigned modular integer arithmetic. We discuss some further performance enhancements of the semi boolean polynomial encoder and finally supply a complexity estimation.

With the embodiment of copious domains to social networks and unprecedented rise in the data - produced, accessed and stored globally; the task of handling the unpredictable, dynamic and ever evolving topological nature of social networks has become arduous. In this regard, quantum computing (QC) has emerged as the most promising trailblazer guaranteeing unprecedented data storage and manipulation capabilities by- dynamic allocation of cluster size and architecture, quantum parallelism, reduced parameter dependency, etc. QC based algorithms have registered exponential speedup over many classical problems with better efficiency and abated time complexity; apart from solving NP-hard problems that were unrealizable classically. Accordingly, a comprehensive literature survey has been presented for social network analysis and community detection highlighting the limitations prevalent in the current technologies. A brief insight into quantum computing and its proficiency in rendering to larger storage systems has been presented; as a solution to the inherent problems present in the existing community detection approaches. A systematic account of quantum computing based community detection techniques has been summarized and discussed as a more prudent future alternative to social network analysis and community detection. Lastly, complexity analysis and modularity based comparison of QC based algorithms with other state of the art algorithms has been carried out to establish the supremacy of quantum algorithms in community detection.

However, no quantum error-correcting code (QECC) can transversally implement a quantum universal gate set (Eastin and Knill, Phys. Rev. Lett., 102, 110502). Since reversible classical computation is often a dominating part of useful quantum computation, whether or not it can be implemented transversally is an important open problem. We show that, other than a small set of non-additive codes that we cannot rule out, no binary QECC can transversally implement a classical reversible universal gate set. In particular, no such QECC can implement the Toffoli gate transversally. We prove our result by constructing an information theoretically secure (but inefficient) quantum homomorphic encryption (ITS-QHE) scheme inspired by Ouyang et al. (arXiv:1508.00938). Homomorphic encryption allows the implementation of certain functions directly on encrypted data, i.e. homomorphically. Our scheme builds on almost any QECC, and implements that code's transversal gate set homomorphically. We observe a restriction imposed by Nayak's bound (FOCS 1999) on ITS-QHE, implying that any ITS quantum fully homomorphic scheme (ITS-QFHE) implementing the full set of classical reversible functions must be highly inefficient.

In fact, the use of quantum mechanical principles can enable parallel execution of fuzzy rules and allow them to be used efficiently in complex contexts such as distributed and big data environments. This article introduces the very first quantum-based fuzzy inference engine that is capable of providing exponential acceleration in fuzzy rule execution compared to its classical counterpart, and allows a quantum computer to be programmed by fuzzy linguistic rules. The proposed inference engine was implemented using a quantum algorithm design scheme based on the oracle notion. This scheme allows the modeling of a fuzzy rule-based system as a Boolean function, the oracle, which is able to reconstruct the relationships between the antecedent and consequent parts of fuzzy rules, and can be efficiently computed on a quantum computer.

Many fundamental questions will arise along this paper for which we will need to give an answer in order to analyze the basic principles that allow researchers and engineers to put AI and QC working together. With this in mind, we will briefly describe the behavior of the biological brain focusing on the identification of the singularities that allow them to perform in such an efficient manner. Energy consumption and parallelism are in the core of the above-mentioned efficiency. Then we will present some of the well-established artificial intelligence approaches that are potentially related to the operation of biological brains. After identifying common characteristics we will introduce basic concepts and issues related to the so-called reversible computing and QC that may eventually help to increase the efficiency of our current intelligent systems. In this respect, we will pay special attention to 'speed' and 'energy consumption'.

The security definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based, and not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable, computational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new definitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational: a scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into an ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to block messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By modifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one gets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations are composable, resulting in composable security. Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the asymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite reduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from the ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite instance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to make security claims about concrete implementations. We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the literature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the relations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones. In particular, we look at notions of quantum authenticated encryption and QCCA2, and show that they suffer from the same issues as their classical counterparts: they exclude certain protocols which are arguably secure.",43,3,3,0,1,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-36030-6; 978-3-030-36029-0,,2019,10.1007/978-3-030-36030-6_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36030-6_12,30,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BQ6FO,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The PIM computing architecture becomes popular due to its effective framework for storage and computation of data in a single unit. Here, we illustrate two input NAND and NOR gate with the help of QCA based Akers array as a case study. The QCA Flip-Flop is used as a primitive cell to design PIM architecture. The results suggest that both the gates have minimum power dissipation. The polarization results of proposed architecture suggest that the signals are in good control. The footprint of the primitive cell equals to 0.04 mu m(2), which is smaller than conventional CMOS primitive cell. The combination of QCA and Akers array provides many additional benefits over the conventional architecture like reduction in the power consumption and feature size, furthermore, it also improves the computational speed.

J,"Takeuchi, Y; Morimae, T; Tani, S","Takeuchi, Yuki; Morimae, Tomoyuki; Tani, Seiichiro",Sumcheck-based delegation of quantum computing to rational server,THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,English,Article; Early Access,Quantum computing; Rational interactive proof; Game theory,IMPOSSIBILITY; COMPLEXITY; UNIVERSAL,"Delegated quantum computing enables a client with weak computational power to delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the integrity of the server can be efficiently verified by the client. Recently, a new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the server, the client pays a reward to the server depending on the server's messages and the client's random bits. The rational server sends messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational sumcheck protocol. An advantage of our protocols is that they are gate-set independent: the construction of the previous rational protocols depends on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any local gate set (each of whose elementary gates can be specified with a polynomial number of bits). Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward function satisfies natural requirements (the reward is non-negative, upper-bounded by a constant, and its maximum expected value is lower-bounded by a constant). We also discuss the reward gap. Simply speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept an incorrect answer. The reward gap should therefore be large enough to incentivize the server to behave optimally. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between rational and ordinary delegated quantum computing protocols. This equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

In this framework, a sustainable computation offloading strategy is obtained while guaranteeing the individual latency constraints and the required success ratio for each computation task.

In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques like surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we virtualize logical qubits by storing them in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon. Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal application of CNOT operations between logical qubits sharing the same physical address (same set of cavities) which are 6x faster than standard lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves approximately 10x in transmons with another 2x savings from an additional optimization for compactness. Although qubit virtualization pays a 10x penalty in serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and in area efficiency result in fault-tolerance and performance comparable to conventional 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show our system can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional two-dimensional grids while saving substantial hardware. Furthermore, our architecture can produce magic states at 1.22x the baseline rate given a fixed number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers as magic states are essential and machines will spend the majority of their resources continuously producing them. This architecture substantially reduces the hardware requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing and puts within reach a proofof-concept experimental demonstration of around 10 logical qubits, requiring only 11 transmons and 9 attached cavities in total.",23,4,6,2,5,,,978-1-7281-7383-2,,2020,10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00026,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MICRO50266.2020.00026,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BT0UC,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

While scaled quantum computing may seem a distant concern, we believe there are good reasons for an organization to start now in developing its understanding of the situation and creating a phased action plan toward PQC readiness.",42,0,0,0,1,,,978-989-758-553-1,,2021,10.5220/0010886000003120,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010886000003120,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BT3FD,hybrid,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The circuit model for topological quantum computation differs from the conventional quantum circuit model even in the logic level; which is multiple CNOT gates can only be performed at the same time if the order of qubits satisfies a certain property. Thus, there has been a wide research to find a good qubit order in one-dimension to satisfy such a property for topological quantum computation. This paper proposes a new method by using two-dimensional qubit layouts for topological quantum computation in order to reduce the computational time steps instead of one-dimensional qubit layouts used by the conventional computer. The general idea is to find a good two-dimensional qubit layout, so our propose is to find the best set of one-dimensional qubit layouts exactly by solving a minimum clique partition problem, and by then we will find the best two-dimensional layout that can embed as many of one-dimensional layouts as possible. The further task may need a very time-consuming(exponential number of) enumerations because we try to find the best possible solution by using an efficient graph structure called pi DDs. Indeed, despite this, we still could not find a solution for larger cases more than 16 qubits (4x4 layout) case in our preliminary experiment. Thus, we also implement an SA-based method in order to find a good two-dimensional qubit layout for a reasonable time. Our preliminary experiment shows that the SA-based method works very well for larger cases.",5,0,0,0,4,0302-9743,,978-3-319-08494-7; 978-3-319-08493-0,,2014,,,13,"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Logic",Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BB6XR,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Real-world applications, however, cannot yet be managed directly due to the limitation of present and near-future noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Decomposition into smaller and manageable subproblems is often needed to take advantage of QC even when using hybrid (classical-quantum) solvers or solvers that already apply decomposition techniques. In this paper, heuristic decomposition algorithms to solve the Physical Cell Identifier (PCI) problem in 4G cellular networks in a way suitable for QC are presented. The PCI problem can be viewed as a map coloring problem with additional constraints and has been represented in a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, a form that, for instance, a quantum annealing machine could crunch. We propose two strategies, with variable decomposition granularity. The first one solves the problem recursively through bisection (max-cut problem), to use only one qubit to represent the status of the objects, avoiding onehot encoding and thus minimizing the qubit requirement. The second is a multi-step approach, finally solving sets of randomized modified max-k-cut problems of customizable qubit size.

In order to execute corresponding quantum algorithms (usually provided in terms of quantum circuits), certain physical constraints in the architectures need to be satisfied. More precisely, physical constraints restrict the possible interactions between qubits which frequently result in cases where qubits which are supposed to interact in a quantum circuit are not allowed to interact on the physical device. Thus far, this is addressed by dedicated methods that map the logical quantum circuit to a physical realization and satisfy the constraints by inserting further operations. This leads to additional costs which harm the fidelity of the circuit and, hence, urgently need to be avoided. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art approaches for this mapping process take the existing architectures as invariant and only try to reduce the number of additionally needed operations. In contrast, (slight) changes in the, respectively, given architectures (which still keep the underlying physical constraints satisfied) might be possible and may allow for even better (i.e., less costly) mappings. But this potential has not been investigated yet. In this work, we explore this potential. More precisely, we introduce several schemes for generating alternative coupling graphs (and, by this, quantum computing architectures) that still might be able to satisfy physical constraints but, at the same time, allow for a more efficient realization of the desired quantum functionality. Evaluations confirm the potential of those alternative coupling graphs and demonstrate that they can reduce the mapping overhead by up to 60% in the best case and up to almost 40% on average.",60,4,4,0,1,0278-0070,1937-4151,,SEP,2021,10.1109/TCAD.2020.3032072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2020.3032072,11,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,UC8FL,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality.

Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness-the computation is hidden from the server-and those that are also verifiable - the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct trace-distance-type criteria-which are, individually, non-composable security definitions.

The time in which the ISMS is restored is a critical aspect. In this sense, classic solutions are efficient in resolving scenarios with a moderate number of incidents in a reasonable time, but the response time increases exponentially as the number of incidents increases. This makes classical solutions unsuitable for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled and even less appropriate for scenarios in which security management is offered as a service to several companies.

However, testing quantum computations for faults is currently impractical because of the existence of noise and errors associated with the output. Executing in a quantum system a circuit with only a few valid output states can generate a significant number of implausible states that have zero probability in an ideal computation. Among other sources of noise, readout errors come from the difficulty of discriminating a measurement between 0 and 1 for the different qubits. These issues are affected by readout drift, requiring regular recalibration of the process. In this paper, we provide a novel technique for postcomputation analysis of the output probability distributions that permits better discrimination of kerneled data, delaying the need for recalibration. We achieve this by altering the linear discrimination of the final output states by way of a dynamic state selection process that combines Gaussian mixture models with a probability threshold. As an initial assessment of the technique we examine its effect on three to five qubits GHZ states.

Qubits, the basic unit of quantum computing have the power to exist in more than one state at a time. While the classical computers only perform operations by manipulation of classical bits having two values 0 and 1, quantum bits can represent data in multiple states. This property of inheriting multiple states at a time is called superposition which gives quantum computers tremendous power over classical computers. With this power, the algorithms designed on quantum computers to solve search queries can yield result significantly faster than the classical algorithms. There are four types of problems that exist: Polynomial (P), Non-Deterministic Polynomial (NP), Non-Deterministic Polynomial Complete (NP-complete) and Non-Deterministic Polynomial hard (NP-hard). P problems can be solved in the polynomial amount of time like searching a database for an item. However, when the size of the search space grows, it becomes difficult to compute solutions even for P problems. Quantum algorithms like Grover's algorithm has reduced the tvime complexity of some of the classical algorithm problems from N to root N. Variants of Grover's algorithm like Quantum Partial Search propose changes that yield not exact but closer results in time even lesser than Grover's algorithm. NP problems are the problems whose solution if known can be verified in polynomial amount time.

Then, these procedures are generalized for constructing binary n-bit reversible comparator circuit. The design synthesis consists of two parts: Comparator Cell and Propagator Cell. An algorithm, based on our proposed design, shows that proposed circuit reduces overall cost and it outperforms than existing sequential comparator circuits.

In this novel quantum algorithm, the oracles of the two evaluated functions are executed in series to yield a common target qubit which then interacts with an ancillary qubit. We found that the degree of entanglement (measured by the concurrence) of the target and ancillary qubits is a reliable witness for the logical equivalence property of the two functions. The steps number of the quantum algorithm is inversely proportional to the square of the standard error epsilon 2 of the measured concurrence value, with no dependence on the input size ' n ' of each function. This corresponds to a number of evaluations of the two functions: O(epsilon-2) for the quantum algorithm compared with O(2n) for the classical approach. To assess the algorithm performance, two sets of experiments are conducted using the IBM Q Experience simulator for input sizes: 2 and 12 variables per function. While the former verifies that the results of the experiment are in a good match with the theory, the latter showcases the quantum supremacy of the presented algorithm.

This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs Omega(root N/ log N) queries (improving an Omega(N-1/4) lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus S2( /N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N1-1/2t)_ query randomized algorithm.

Conversely, we show that this 1 versus (Omega) over tilde(root N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N1-1/2t)-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. [SIAM J.

Understanding environmental decoherence processes and the way they are modeled is fundamental in order to construct effective error correction methods capable of protecting quantum information.

Machine Learning (ML) techniques are employed routinely to analyze and process these big EO data, and one well-known ML technique is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). An SVM poses a quadratic programming problem, and quantum computers including quantum annealers (QA) as well as gate-based quantum computers promise to solve an SVM more efficiently than a conventional computer; training the SVM by employing a quantum computer/conventional computer represents a quantum SVM (qSVM)/classical SVM (cSVM) application. However, quantum computers cannot tackle many practical EO problems by using a qSVM due to their very low number of input qubits.

The coreset is a small, representative weighted subset of an original dataset, and its performance can be analyzed by using the proposed weighted SVM on a small quantum computer in contrast to the original dataset.

However, with the advent of quantum technology, these modern devices' potential to overcome this tractability limitation requires exploration. This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation algorithms' performance to solve two common COP, namely the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem. Two accepted classical optimisation methods, Branch and Bound and Simulated Annealing, are compared to two quantum optimisation methods, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are, respectively, executed on both classical devices and IBM' s suite of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We have encoded the COP problems for the respective technologies and algorithms and provided the computational encodings for the NISQ devices. Our experimental results show that current classical devices significantly outperform the presently available NISQ devices, which both agree with and extend on those findings reported in the literature. Further, we introduce additional performance metrics to better compare the two approaches with respect to computational time, feasibility and solution quality. Our results show that the VQE performs better than QAOA with respect to these metrics, and we infer that this is due to the increased number of operations required. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a new set of basis gates on the quantum optimisation techniques and show they yield no notable improvement on obtained results.

Firstly, by using the advantages of measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), the registered client and the assigned server could share the initial key safely in registration phase. Secondly, with the help of semi-honest certificate authority (CA), mutual identity authentication phase realizes the two-way authentication from both sides through the shared key simultaneously. Thirdly, in the blind quantum computing phase, a registered client can complete his computing task by just measuring the qubits from the assigned server rather than preparing the qubits. Moreover, combined with first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, clients' authentication and blind quantum computing can be processed in parallel.

However, with the rapid increase in technology and population, the task of examining the patient becomes cumbersome and sometimes human efforts produce inconsistent results. Several research is being done for healthcare in terms of improving visualization and accuracy by using machine learning models. The current research targets to explore quantum computing as a different way of processing information compared to classical computer systems such as the use of quantum bits (qubits) along with superposition and entanglement for extending the computation capabilities at an unprecedented level of thinking in the healthcare domain. Quantum computing systems provide exponential benefits in terms of high-speed processing, faster and easier diagnostic assistance, unimaginable reduction in processing throughput, and many more. An extensive comparative analysis of existing approaches has been made which benchmarks the need for quantum healthcare computing. The objective of this work is to interpret whether Quantum computers prove to be more trusted when it comes to patient diagnosis, and faster analysis leading to cost optimization. In order to accelerate patient diagnosis, different approaches have been presented. The authors have proposed a precision-based granular approach for patient diagnosis that incorporates diagnosing the disease with enhanced precision and granularity. It involves reporting symptoms by the patient, encountering by healthcare expert on multiple factors, precise examination, granular health status (understanding past and present medical history), followed by a precise intervention by understanding biomolecular simulations. The algorithm has been presented to describe the flow process for patient diagnosis modeling using quantum computing. It involves qubits initialization, pairing the values, assigning probabilistic values, cross validation, and quantum circuit formation. Precision-based granular approach has been implemented for a scenario (consisting of medical parameters such as oxygen and heart rate level, with the functionality of diagnosing oxygen level and heart range which lies as either normal or not normal (high/low)). Precision-based granular approach deals specifically with the individual 'biomolecular simulation by understanding variations in the individual body whereas the umbrella-based approach does not deal with specifically to individual mechanisms. Granular level of encounter is not possible in umbrella-based treatment. Python Jupyter notebook and IBM Composer tool is used for the implementation of results. Bloch sphere and computational state graph are obtained as an output for better visualization and understanding. Falcon r5.11H processor is used with the version of 1.0.24 of IBM Composer to simulate the experiment. The methodology using precision based granular approach provides timely encounter of disease along with umbrella diagnosis and precise treatment.

Designing suitable molecular unit is then common ground for chemists and computer scientists, and a shaky one.

Unfortunately, these devices are restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges. For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here, we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision. When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through modularity. Our results demonstrate that chiplet architectures, relative to monolithic designs, benefit from average yield improvements ranging from 9.6 - 92.6 x for less than or similar to 500 qubit machines. In addition, our simulations explore the design space of chiplet systems and discover configurations that demonstrate average two-qubit gate infidelity reductions that are at best 0.815 x their monolithic counterpart.

The main issue to be addressed in CGI technology is how to achieve rapid and high-quality imaging while assuring the secure transmission of detection data in practical distant imaging applications. In order to address the mentioned issues, this paper proposes a remote secure CGI method based on quantum communication technology. Using the quantum key distribution (QKD) network, the CGI system can be reconstructed while solving the problem of information security transmission between the detector and the reconstructed computing device. By exploring the influence of different random measurement matrices on the quality of image reconstruction, it is found that the randomness of the numerical sequence constituting the matrix is positively correlated with the imaging quality. Based on this discovery, a new type of quantum cryptography measurement matrix is constructed using quantum cryptography with good randomness.

Execution of a quantum gate in multiple trap TI system may frequently involve ions from two different traps, hence one of the ions needs to be shuttled (moved) between traps to be co-located, degrading fidelity, and increasing the program execution time. The choice of initial mapping influences the number of shuttles. The existing Greedy policy neglects the depth of the program at which a gate is present. Intuitively, the contribution of the late-stage gates to the initial mapping is less since the ions might have already shuttled to a different trap to satisfy other gate operations. In this paper, we target this gap and propose a new program adaptive policy especially for programs with considerable depth and high number of qubits (valid for practical-scale quantum programs). Our technique achieves an average reduction of 9% shuttles/program (with 21.3% at best) for 120 random circuits and enhances the program fidelity up to 3.3X (1.41X on average).",5,0,0,0,0,,,978-1-4503-9322-5,,2022,10.1145/3526241.3530366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3526241.3530366,4,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BW2KX,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The involvement of big players like Google, IBM, Intel, Rigetti, or Microsoft furthermore led to a momentum which increases the demand for automated design methods for quantum computations. In this context, decision diagrams for quantum computation provide a major pillar as they allow to efficiently represent quantum states and quantum operations which, otherwise, have to be described in terms of exponentially large state vectors and unitary matrices. However, current decision diagrams for the quantum domain suffer from a tradeoff between accuracy and compactness, since: 1) small errors that are inevitably introduced by the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic can harm the compactness (i.e., the size of the decision diagram) significantly and 2) overcompensating these errors (to increase compactness) may lead to an information loss and introduces numerical instabilities. In this article, we describe and evaluate the effects of this tradeoff which clearly motivates the need for a solution that is perfectly accurate and compact at the same time. More precisely, we show that the tradeoff indeed weakens current design automation approaches for quantum computation (possibly leading to corrupted results or infeasible run-times). To overcome this, we propose an alternative approach that utilizes an algebraic representation of the occurring complex and irrational numbers and outline how this can be incorporated in a decision diagram which is suited for quantum computation. Evaluations show that-at the cost of an overhead which is moderate in many cases-the proposed algebraic solution indeed overcomes the tradeoff between accuracy and compactness that is present in current numerical solutions.",39,4,4,1,1,0278-0070,1937-4151,,DEC,2020,10.1109/TCAD.2020.2977603,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2020.2977603,12,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,OV3JT,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the conventional world, this approach is established and its availability taken for granted. For quantum computing however, first approaches exist, but could not fully exploit a similar potential yet. In this paper, we investigate the differences between reordering decision diagrams in the conventional and the quantum world and, afterwards, unveil challenges that explain why reordering is much harder in the latter.

The necessity of the Pauli flow was an open question. We show that Pauli flow is not necessary, providing several counter examples. We prove however that Pauli flow is necessary for determinism in the real MBQC model, an interesting and useful fragment of MBQC. We explore the consequences of this result for real MBQC and its applications. Real MBQC and more generally real quantum computing is known to be universal for quantum computing. Real MBQC has been used for interactive proofs by McKague. The two-prover case corresponds to real-MBQC on bipartite graphs. While (complex) MBQC on bipartite graphs are universal, the universality of real MBQC on bipartite graphs was an open question.

The choice of a two-qubit (2Q) hardware basis gate depends on a quantum modulator's native Hamiltonian interactions and applied control drives. In this paper, we propose a collaborative design approach to select the best ratio of drive parameters that determine the best basis gate for a particular modulator. This requires considering the theoretical computing power of the gate along with the practical speed limit of that gate, given the modulator drive parameters. The practical speed limit arises from the couplers' tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied, for which some combinations can result in higher overall speed limits than others. Moreover, as this 2Q basis gate is typically applied multiple times in succession, interleaved by 1Q gates applied directly to the qubits, the speed of the 1Q gates can become a limiting factor for the quantum circuit, particularly as the pulse length of the 2Q basis gate is optimized. We propose parallel-drive to drive the modulator and qubits simultaneously, allowing a richer capability of the 2Q basis gate and in some cases for this 1Q drive time to be absorbed entirely into the 2Q operation. This allows increasingly short duration 2Q gates to be more practical while mitigating a significant source of overhead in some quantum systems. On average, this approach can decrease circuit duration by 17.8% and decrease infidelity for random 2Q gates by 10.5% compared to the currently best reported basic 2Q gate, root iSWAP.",54,0,0,1,1,1063-6897,,979-8-4007-0095-8,,2023,10.1145/3579371.3589075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3579371.3589075,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BW0OY,Green Submitted,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) model of computing. As NISQ machines exhibit high error-rates, only programs that require a few qubits can be executed reliably. Therefore, NISQ machines tend to underutilize its resources. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput and utilization of NISQ machines by using multi-programming and enabling the NISQ machine to concurrently execute multiple workloads. Multi-programming a NISQ machine is non-trivial. This is because, a multi-programmed NISQ machine can have an adverse impact on the reliability of the individual workloads. To enable multi-programming in a robust manner, we propose three solutions. First, we develop methods to partition the qubits into multiple reliable regions using error information from machine calibration so that each program can have a fair allocation of reliable qubits. Second, we observe that when two programs are of unequal lengths, measurement operations can impact the reliability of the co-running program. To reduce this interference, we propose a Delayed Instruction Scheduling (DIS) policy that delays the start of the shorter program so that all the measurement operations can be performed at the end. Third, we develop an Adaptive Multi-Programming (AMP) design that monitors the reliability at runtime and reverts to single program mode if the reliability impact of multi-programming is greater than a predefined threshold. Our evaluations with IBM-Q16 show that our proposals can improve resource utilization and throughput by up to 2x, while limiting the impact on reliability.",39,47,52,1,4,,,978-1-4503-6938-1,,2019,10.1145/3352460.3358287,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358287,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Computer Science,BO5XZ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our attacks are not as efficient as polynomial-time attacks making quantum superposition queries, while our attacks use the realistic model and overwhelmingly improve the classical attacks. Our attacks convert a type of classical meet-in-the-middle attacks into quantum ones. The attack cost depends on the number of available qubits and the way to realize the quantum hardware. The tradeoffs between data complexity D and time complexity T against the problem of cardinality N are D-2 . T-2 = N and D .T-6 = N-3 in the best and worst case scenarios to the adversary respectively, while the classic attack requires D . T = N. This improvement is meaningful from an engineering aspect because several existing schemes claim beyond-birthday-bound security for T by limiting the maximum D to be below 2(n/2 )according to the classical tradeoff D . T = N. Those schemes are broken when quantum computations are available to the adversaries. The attack can be applied to many schemes such as a tweakable block-cipher construction TDR, a dedicated MAC scheme Chaskey, an on-line authenticated encryption scheme McOE-X, a hash function based MAC H-2 -MAC and a permutation based MAC keyed-sponge.

There are different reversible algorithms for quantum computation and many quantum circuits theoretically designed until now. These designs are only built from reversible gates because reversibility is a necessary logic in quantum circuits. Additionally, ternary representation can allow designing a circuit with fewer inputs and outputs, leading to a considerable decline in size or number of qutrits. Although other papers in quantum ternary reversible logic are in unbalanced representation, this paper, for the first time, considers balanced ternary advantages to achieve a more efficient design for quantum multipliers as the main component in arithmetic blocks. Six criteria are introduced to show how balanced representation increases the overall performance.

The computational approach is robust and inherently sequential. First, the studied physico-chemical system is modeled by a statistical physics approach, either Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD). Though in the first phase it is often sufficient to carry out a classical MC or MD simulation, in particular cases, when it is necessary, one can also perform a quantum molecular dynamics simulation (e.g. ADMP, BOMD or CPMD). Even the classical MC/MD simulations carried out in the first phase can be based on interaction potentials which have been derived by quantum chemical calculations. Sequentially to the first phase of the computation, which actually generates either a MD trajectory or an appropriate sample of the system's configurational space, the generated trajectories are analyzed employing time-series analytic methods. On the basis of such analysis, a representative number of configurations representing the state of the physicochemical system at finite temperature is chosen, which are further analyzed by a quantum mechanical approach. These, appropriately chosen configurations for the system of interest, are further modeled by exact quantum mechanical (QM) approach. The particular approach that needs to be implemented depends on the quantity that needs to be computed. For example, in the case of X-H stretching vibrations, the anharmonic X-H vibrational frequency is computed in a quantum mechanical manner with respect to both electronic and nuclear subsystem. In this case, first a 1D cut through the vibrational potential energy surface is computed at series of suitably generated points, and subsequently, the vibrational Schrodinger equation is solved either by diagonalization approach or using a variant of the discrete variable representation (DVR) methodology. As the statistical mechanics simulations are often done implementing periodic boundary condition, the exact QM calculations in the final simulation phase are often done implementing some sort of embedding of the relevant part of the system. All these aspects of our developed methodology are illustrated through a particular example - the fluoroform solvated in liquid Kr and the noncovalently bonded complexes which are formed between fluoroform and dimethylether in liquid Kr. A vast variety of condensed phase systems can be treated by the developed approach. Achieving good parallel efficiency for calculations of such type is far from a trivial task without the use of high-performance low-latency MPI interconnect (such as, e.g. a supercomputer or HPC cluster).",11,0,0,0,5,2196-7334,,978-3-319-01520-0; 978-3-319-01519-4,,2014,10.1007/978-3-319-01520-0_12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01520-0_12,10,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematics, Applied",Computer Science; Mathematics,BD3WE,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, we present an architectural analysis of a linear-tape architecture for trapped ions. In order to realize our study, we develop and evaluate mapping and scheduling algorithms for this architecture. In particular, we introduce TILT, a linear Turing-machine-like architecture with a multilaser control head, where a linear chain of ions moves back and forth under the laser head. We find that TILT can substantially reduce communication as compared with comparable-sized Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures. We also develop two important scheduling heuristics for TILT. The first heuristic reduces the number of swap operations by matching data traveling in opposite directions into an opposing swap., and also avoids the maximum swap distance across the width of the head, as maximum swap distances make scheduling multiple swaps in one head position difficult. The second heuristic minimizes ion chain motion by scheduling the tape to the position with the maximal executable operations for every movement. We provide application performance results from our simulation, which suggest that TILT can outperform QCCD in a range of NISQ applications in terms of success rate (up to 4.35x and 1.95x on average).

By using this new formulation, we can divide the assigned trustworthiness values to objective and subjective parts. First, we create a mapping between the QDT definitions and the trustworthiness constructions. Then, we demonstrate that it is possible for the quantum interference terms to appear in the trust decision making process. By using the interference terms, we can quantify the emotions and subjective preferences of the trustor in various contexts with different amounts of uncertainty and risk. The non-commutative nature of quantum probabilities is a valuable mathematical tool to model the relative nature of trust. In relative trust models, the evaluation of a trustee candidate is not only dependent on the trustee itself, but on the other existing competitors. In other words, the first evaluation is performed in an isolated context whereas the rest of the evaluations are performed in a comparative one. It is shown that a QDT-based model of trust can account for these order effects in the trust decision making process. Finally, based on the principles of risk and uncertainty aversion, interference alternation theorem and interference quarter law, quantitative values are assigned to interference terms. By performing empirical evaluations, we have demonstrated that various scenarios can be better explained by a quantum model of trust rather than the commonly used classical models.",59,6,8,0,18,1387-3326,1572-9419,,AUG,2016,10.1007/s10796-015-9555-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-015-9555-4,30,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,DS3WQ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, the use of graphs in application domains such as routing, network analysis and resource allocation has become crucial. In these areas, graphs are often evolving in time: for example, connection links may fail due to temporary technical issues, meaning that edges of the graph cannot be traversed for some time interval and alternative paths have to be followed. In classical computation, where graphs are represented as adjacency matrices or lists, these problems are well studied and ad-hoc visit procedures have been developed. For specific problems quantum computation, through superpositions and entanglement has provided faster algorithms than their classical counterpart.

Silicon-based nanostructured qubits appear today as a very interesting approach, because of their higher information density, longer coherence times, fast operation gates, and compatibility with the actual CMOS technology. In particular, thanks to their phase noise properties, the actual CMOS RFIC Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) and Phase-Locked Oscillators (PLO) are interesting circuits to synthesize control signals for spintronic qubits. In a quantum microprocessor, these circuits should operate close to the qubits, that is, at cryogenic temperatures. The lack of commercial cryogenic Design Kits (DK) may make the interface between the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and the Frequency Divider (FD) a serious issue. Nevertheless, currently this issue has not been systematically addressed in the literature. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the VCO/FD interface when the temperature drops from room to cryogenic. To this purpose, physical models of electronics passive/active devices and equivalent circuits of VCO and the FD were developed at room and cryogenic temperatures.

The transitions between the computing model and quantum basis are explained and analyzed considering different linear Hermitian operators.,21,0,0,0,6,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-19369-4,,2015,10.1007/978-3-319-19369-4_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19369-4_7,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BD7KZ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

While quantum computers can be guarded against errors using error correction codes, near-term quantum computers will not have sufficient number of qubits to implement error correction and must perform their computation in the presence of errors. Qubit measurement is typically the most error-prone operation on a quantum computer, with measurement errors ranging from 8% to 30% reported on current machines. This goal of this paper is to mitigate measurement errors by exploiting the state-dependent bias of measurement errors. Experiments on the IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14 machines show variation in measurement errors depending on the state being measured. For example, measuring an all-zero state on IBM-Q5 has a fidelity of 84%; however, the fidelity drops to 62% while measuring the all-one state. To improve measurement fidelity, we propose Invert-and-Measure, which transforms the system from a vulnerable state to a stronger state and then performs the measurement in the stronger state. We propose two designs for Invert-and-Measure. First, Static Invert-and-Measure (SIM), which executes two instances of the program, one with standard measurements and the other with inverted measurements and combines the results. Second, Adaptive Invert and Measure (AIM), which learns the relative bias of different states using runtime profiling and produces specialized inversions to increase the likelihood of obtaining the correct answer. Our evaluations, using IBM-Q5 and IBM-Q14, show that SIM improves the application reliability by up to 2X, and AIM by up to 3X.",32,67,74,1,3,,,978-1-4503-6938-1,,2019,10.1145/3352460.3358265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358265,12,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Computer Science,BO5XZ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

When combined with thermal system parameters such as cooling efficiency and cryostat heat transfer, the total energy use can be determined using a first-principles energy model. These models show that cooling of quantum computers differs in two fundamental ways from conventional data centers: (1) the energy required for cooling is much greater than the energy required for computation, and (2) the cooling loads are sensitive to the computational architecture. The temperature requirements for different qubit types can change energy requirements by orders of magnitude.

Indeed this machine solves a spin glass problem with programmable coefficients but subject to quite strong topology restrictions on the set of non-zero coefficients. Rather than mapping problem variables onto multiple qbits, an approach which requires many invocations of the annealer to solve small size problems, it is tempting to investigate the existence of sparse relaxations compliant with the qbits interconnection topology of the machine, hence solvable in one invocation of the annealing oracle, but still providing good-quality solutions to the original problem. This paper provides an experimental setup which aims to determine whether or not such convenient relaxations do exist or, rather, are easy to find. Our experiments suggest that it is not the case and, therefore, that solving even moderate size arbitrary problems with a single call to a quantum annealer is not possible at least within the constraints of the so-called Chimera topology.

Ultimately, each party receives only its own correct output. In this paper, a post-quantum secure two-party computation protocol is proposed that can be used to effectively block malicious parties. The protocol solves the problems of traditional protocols based on garbled circuits, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks, high communication costs and low computational efficiency. The input garbled keys of the circuit constructor is structured as a Learning with Error (LWE) equation, enabling the circuit constructor to employ a zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates the uniformity of inputs across all circuits.In the key transfer phase, an LWE-based batch single-choice cut-and-choose oblivious transfer is proposed to avoid selective failure attacks. In addition, the protocol employs a penalty mechanism to detect if the circuit constructor has generated an incorrect circuit. We have compared the communication overhead of this protocol with three other secure two-party computation protocols based on Cut-and-Choose technology. The analytical results show that this protocol has the best error probability and is resilient to quantum attacks under the malicious adversary model.

This is in contrast to previous protocols, whose overhead in terms of resources employed, while polynomial, is far beyond what is feasible in practice. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit or its input. The second protocol is not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction.

Arbitrated dynamics between layers of light set up a mechanism of feedback-loops and constitute a process of persistent quantum-level computation, whose output is suggested to be genetic-type information.

To prevent a violation of causality, this simulation succeeds up to local errors that can only be corrected after the parties communicate classically with one another. However, this communication is non-interactive, and it involves just the broadcasting of local measurement outcomes. We refer to this operational paradigm as local operations and broadcast communication (LOBC) to distinguish it from the standard local operations and (interactive) classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we show that an arbitrary two-qubit gate can be implemented by LOBC with \epsilon -error using {O}(\log (1/\epsilon)) entangled bits (ebits). This offers an exponential improvement over the best known two-qubit protocols, whose ebit costs behave as {O}(1/\epsilon) . We also consider the family of binary controlled gates on dimensions {d}_{A}\otimes {d}_{B} . We find that any hermitian gate of this form can be implemented by LOBC using a single shared ebit. In sharp contrast, a lower bound of \log {d}_{B} ebits is shown in the case of generic (i.e. non-hermitian) gates from this family, even when {d}_{A}=2 . This demonstrates an unbounded gap between the entanglement costs of LOCC and LOBC gate implementation.

In order to achieve parallelism, one aims to increase the number of simultaneous measurements, such that the effects of decoherence on the resource state are minimised due to the reduction of the time required to run the computation. At the heart of this question is the notion of quantum information flow, which specifies the dependency relations between the measurements in the computations. There exist two well-known techniques for reducing the time required to perform a one-way quantum computation without changing its semantics. The first one, called signal-shifting, transforms the flow of a graph (representing the resource state) within the measurement calculus formalism, whereas the second one, namely finding the maximally-delayed generalised flow, explores the geometry of the graph to increase the number of Operations that can be performed simultaneously. In this paper, we show for the first time how these two techniques relate to each other. We prove that the application of the signal-shifting rules to a measurement pattern with flow results in a generalised flow for the pattern.

In this work, we present a tool to simulate the execution of fault-tolerant quantum computation by automating the tracking of common fault paths for error propagation through an encoded circuit block and quantifying the failure probability of each encoded qubit throughout the circuit. Our simulator runs a fault path counter on encoded circuit blocks to determine the probability that two or more errors remain on the encoded qubits after each block is executed, and it combines errors from all the encoded blocks to estimate performance metrics such as the logical qubit failure probability, the overall circuit failure probability, the number of qubits used, and the time required to run the overall circuit. Our technique efficiently estimates the upper bound of the error probability and provides a useful measure of the error threshold at low error probabilities where conventional Monte Carlo methods are ineffective.

The security of these techniques requires a common secret key to be shared between the communicating entities or depend upon the premise that some mathematical problems are computationally hard. However, because of the open nature of the wireless medium, the communication cannot be kept confidential and is prone to eavesdropping. Furthermore, with the arrival of quantum computers, these techniques are prone to quantum attacks-the time complexity of the assumed hard problem gets reduced from millions of years to a few seconds. In this paper, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on a quantum key distribution protocol for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our scheme inherits the properties of the quantum key distribution protocol. It does not require a secret authentication key to be transmitted conventionally and is resistant to quantum attacks.

Pyrazinamidase, activator for pyrazinamide, leads to resistance against the drug due to mutagenicity across the world. The present study aimed at the quantum mechanistic analysis of mutations in pyrazinamidase to gain insights into the mechanism of this enzyme. Quantum mechanical calculations were performed to analyse the effect of mutations at the metal coordination site using ORCA software program.

In order to elucidate the behaviour of the mutant pyrazinamidase, docking of PZA in the binding pocket of PZase was performed using AutoDock Vina. Analysis of results revealed that iron showed weak binding with the metal coordination site of the mutant proteins due to alteration in electron transfer mechanism. The binding cavity of the mutant PZase has undergone major conformational changes as the volume of pocket increased due to bulky R-chains of mutated amino acids.

By lateralization, we mean the use of biology as the correct format for the implementation of ubiquitous computerized systems, a format that might in many circumstances eschew miniaturization as an overly expensive useless advantage whereas in other cases miniaturization might play a key role. Thus, the future of computer science is not towards a miniaturization that goes from the atom-scale (its present application scale) towards the nucleus-scale, but rather in developing more integrated circuits at the micrometer to nanometer scale, so as to better mimic and interact with biological systems. We analyze some almost sci-fi approaches to the development of better computer systems near the Bekenstein bound limit, and unsurprisingly they fail to have any realistic feasibility. Then, we use the difference between the classical vs. quantum version of the Hammerstein-Clifford theorem to explain why biological systems eschewed quantum computation to represent the world but have chosen classical computation instead. Finally, we analyze examples of recent work which indicate future possibilities of integration between computers and biological systems. As a corollary of that choice by the biological systems, we propose that the predicted lateralization-driven evolution in computer science will not be based in quantum computers, but rather in classical computers.",53,3,3,1,13,1533-7146,,,FEB,2020,,,13,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology; Physics, Particles & Fields; Physics, Mathematical",Computer Science; Physics,KH4LC,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal variations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC architectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological stabilizer codes.",62,2,2,2,4,1072-4451,,978-1-6654-6272-3,,2022,10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00079,16,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BU2SX,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In light of this, we propose a new 3D FTQC scheme by exploiting geometric tolerance to erasure errors using cluster states with novel lattice structures, specifically, by replacing the physical qubits with small-sized error detection codes that allow simple applications of logical CZ gates. We are able to locate Pauli errors locally and effectively convert them into loss errors. With a combination of code concatenation and multi-staged decoding, the scheme is able to achieve higher performance than traditional cubic lattices in protecting quantum information. We have surveyed a wide range of possible concatenation schemes and Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed on the decoders to study their respective scaling behavior. The scheme has demonstrated an overall decrement in active qubit overhead and an improvement of the error threshold, which varies from 10% to 160% depending on the noise model, indicating a relatively higher rate of fault tolerance compared with previous cluster states-based codes.",10,0,0,0,1,,,978-1-6654-9113-6,,2022,10.1109/QCE53715.2022.00113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QCE53715.2022.00113,2,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology",Computer Science; Physics,BU3QX,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. That is, it allows a large set of different physical operations to be realized on the qubits, based on the input angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time. Studying this tradeoff is challenging because of the diversity in QC application requirements, the need to optimize applications for widely different hardware gate types and noise variations across gate types. Therefore, our work develops NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude.

Firstly, based on a diversified initial population strategy, an improved circle chaotic mapping theory was proposed, and an initial population with more randomness and diversity was obtained by combining quantum computations with a quantum gate mutation mechanism. Secondly, using an enhanced search strategy, an adaptive T-distribution and a new position update formula were constructed to accelerate the convergence and enhance its variability. Finally, a dynamic evolution formula was designed for the precision elimination mechanism. Based on this, individuals with poor fitness are replaced by new individuals generated using this formula. In addition, a new boundary control strategy was proposed. The convergence of QMESSA was systematically proven, and the proposed algorithm was tested on 24 benchmark functions and CEC 2017 functions. The experiment results as well as the results of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test show that QMESSA achieves a better comprehensive performance than SSA and other advanced optimization algorithms.

The problem becomes even more challenging considering the dynamic nature of these mobile devices. Job scheduling being nondeterministic polynomial time-complete allows the use of evolutionary approaches by exploring and exploiting the search space efficiently. The exploration gets boosted even more with the use of quantum-computing concepts. This work proposes a quantum-inspired Newtonian approach of attraction based on gravitational search algorithm for scheduling the jobs on mobile computational grid. Simulation study has been performed to evaluate the performance of the model over various dimensions. A comparative study has been performed with quantum-genetic algorithm.

Computer simulations suggest that V1 simple cells use lateral inhibition to generate sparse representations that are selective for 3D depth when presented with 2D stereo images and video. Analogously, we cast radiographic inference as a sparse coding problem employing lateral inhibition between binary neurons, resulting in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem suitable for implementation on a quantum annealing D-Wave 2X (1152-qubit) computer. We generated synthetic radiographs by performing discrete Abel transforms on mathematically-defined objects possessing axial (cylindrical) symmetry and whose radially density profile was given by the sum of a randomly-chosen, sparse set of (nearly binary) Fourier components. We used embedding tools to map the above QUBO problem, which involved dense connections between up to 47 Fourier coefficients, onto the very sparsely connected D-Wave chimera. Using quantum inference, we were able to reconstruct reasonably accurate radial density profiles even after adding sufficiently noise to our synthetic radiographs to make inverse Abel transforms untenable. Compared to state-of-the-art classical QUBO solvers, GUROBI and the Hamze-Freitas-Selby algorithm, the quantum D-Wave 2X was orders of magnitude faster for the same final accuracy.

Recently, US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a competition to standardize lightweight hash functions, which can be used in IoT applications. IoT communication involves various hardware platforms, from low-end microcontrollers to high-end cloud servers with GPU accelerators. Since many sensor nodes are connected to the gateway devices and cloud servers, performing high throughput integrity check is important to secure IoT applications. However, this is a time consuming task even for high-end servers, which may affect the response time in IoT systems. Moreover, no prior work had evaluated the performance of NIST candidates on contemporary processors like GPU and quantum computers.

Mobile user devices are difficult to meet the task requirements due to limited computing capacity. To handle this situation, a mobile edge computing system requires to be constructed. Nevertheless, in the mobile edge computing system, if no popular content is cached in the edge server, users will repeatedly send requests to a remote cloud data center when requesting content, which will cause delay and backhaul link load. To handle this situation, this article plans to put forward a content caching policy. In this policy, the caching benefit in cache replacement, delay in transmission and backhaul link load is taken into account in the content cache. Then DQN is used to handle the problem to obtain the optimal content caching scheme. In addition, in the mobile edge computing environment, the computing capacity of mobile user devices is limited, so task data needs to be unloaded to the edge server for local or remote execution to improve the computing capacity. To handle the above problems, this article plans to put forward a quantum ant colony based computing offloading strategy. This strategy takes into account three aspects: delay, energy consumption and server cost. Quantum ant colony algorithm is used to handle the situation. Experimental results indicate that the content caching strategy based on DQN can effectively improve cache hit percentage, and cut down transmission delay and return link load. Quantum ant colony based computational offloading strategies can increase task completion rates, and decrease task completion delays, equipment energy consumption and total system cost.

Such Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can produce incorrect output as the computation is subjected to errors. The applications on a NISQ machine try to infer the correct output by running the same program thousands of times and logging the output. If the error rates are low and the errors are not correlated, then the correct answer can be inferred as the one appearing with the highest frequency. Unfortunately, quantum computers are subjected to correlated errors, which can cause an incorrect answer to appear more frequently than the correct answer. We observe that recent work on qubit mapping (including the recent work on variation-aware mapping) tries to obtain the best possible qubit allocation and uses it for all the trials. This approach significantly increases the vulnerability to correlated errors - if the mapping becomes susceptible to a particular form of error, then all the trials will get subjected to the same error, which can cause the same wrong answer to appear as the output for a significant fraction of the trials. To mitigate the vulnerability to such correlated errors, this paper leverages the concept of diversity and proposes an Ensemble of Diverse Mappings (EDM). EDM uses diversity in qubit allocation to run copies of an input program with a diverse set of mappings, thus steering the trials towards making different mistakes. By combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, EDM amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect answers. Our experiments with ibmq-melbourne (14-qubit) machine shows that EDM improves the inference quality by 2.3x compared to the current state-of-the-art mapping algorithms.",47,58,67,1,4,,,978-1-4503-6938-1,,2019,10.1145/3352460.3358257,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3352460.3358257,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture",Computer Science,BO5XZ,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubit TI devices, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD-based TI systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive application-driven architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. To enable our study, we built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

Thereafter, the attention is directed to answering the question set out; (ii) Secondly, it digs into the understanding of life toward deeper levels of reality; (iii) It is shown that non-trivial quantum effects shed insightful lights on the information processing of and within living beings; (iv) Once the distinction is made between increasing levels of complexity and increasing levels of organization, the focus lies in the importance of QB for organization, and not so much for complexity as such; (v) The role of information rises at the center of all concerns, and the intertwining of complexity and information processing. At the end some conclusions are drawn. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Gene selection problem has a large number of genes (relevant, redundant or noise), which needs an effective method to help us in detecting diseases and cancer. In this problem, computational complexity is reduced by selecting a small number of genes, but it is necessary to choose the relevant genes to keep a high level of accuracy. Therefore, in order to find the optimal gene subset, it is essential to devise an effective exploration approach that can investigate a large number of possible gene subsets. In addition, it is required to use a powerful evaluation method to evaluate the relevance of these gene subsets. In this paper, we present a novel swarm intelligence algorithm for gene selection called quantum moth flame optimization algorithm (QMFOA), which based on hybridization between quantum computation and moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm. The purpose of QMFOA is to identify a small gene subset that can be used to classify samples with high accuracy. The QMFOA has a simple two-phase approach, the first phase is a pre-processing that uses to address the difficulty of high-dimensional data, which measure the redundancy and the relevance of the gene, in order to obtain the relevant gene set. The second phase is a hybridization among MFOA, quantum computing, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, etc., in order to solve the gene selection problem. We use quantum computing to guarantee a good trade-off between the exploration and the exploitation of the search space, while a new update moth operation using Hamming distance and Archimedes spiral allows an efficient exploration of all possible gene-subsets. The main objective of the second phase is to determine the best relevant gene subset of all genes obtained in the first phase. In order to assess the performance of the proposed QMFOA, we test QMFOA on thirteen microarray datasets (six binary-class and seven multi-class) to evaluate and compare the classification accuracy and the number of genes selected by the QMFOA against many recently published algorithms. Experimental results show that QMFOA provides greater classification accuracy and the ability to reduce the number of selected genes compared to the other algorithms.",66,34,34,2,18,1868-5137,1868-5145,,2021 FEB,2021,10.1007/s12652-020-02434-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02434-9,20,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Telecommunications,QQ9KK,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The hydrodynamic analogue of this model is a flow in which the viscosity is absent and all rotational flow is carried by quantized vortices with identical topological line-structure and circulation. Numerical simulations start from an initial state containing a large number of quantized vortices and follow the chaotic vortex interactions leading to a vortex-tangle turbulent state. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved using a parallel (MPI-OpenMP) code based on a pseudo-spectral spatial discretization and second order splitting for the time integration. We define four quantum-turbulence simulation cases based on different methods used to generate initial states: the first two are based on the hydrodynamic analogy with classical Taylor-Green and Arnold-Beltrami-Childress vortex flows, while the other two methods use a direct manipulation of the wave function by generating a smoothed random phase field, or seeding random vortex-ring pairs. The dynamics of the turbulent field corresponding to each case is analysed in detail by presenting statistical properties (spectra and structure functions) of main quantities of interest (energy, helicity, etc.). Some general features of quantum turbulence are identified, despite the variety of initial states. Numerical and physical parameters of each case are presented in detail by defining corresponding benchmarks that could be used to validate or calibrate new Gross-Pitaevskii codes.

They are used in meeting the demand of executing large-scale high-performance computational jobs. Scheduling the tasks on such computational resources is one of the prime concerns in the heterogeneous distributed systems. Scheduling requires optimizing either single objective or multiple objectives. Load Imbalance (LIB) and Load balancing Cost Ratio (LCR) are two such objectives. LIB and LCR are used in deciding the distribution of load over available resources for utilization and the computational cost respectively. Scheduling jobs with precedence constraints are NP-complete in nature. Scheduling requires either heuristic or metaheuristic approach for sub-optimal but acceptable solutions. Quantum computing is one such meta heuristic approach. It has proven to be promising in addressing the multi-objective scheduling problems with an effective exploration of the search space. This work proposes a dual-objective Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm based Load Balancing Strategy (QGLBS) for workflow application with the objective of optimizing both LIB and LCR. The DAG representation of the batch of jobs helps in effective exploitation of the parallelism available at the job level as well as the sub job level with the modules at the same level of the batch executing at the same time. The strategy ensures that the communication cost and the critical path are considered in making scheduling decisions. QGLBS exploits the features of Quantum Computing and Genetic Algorithm to establish the Pareto fronts using non-dominated sorting based on NSGA-II. Hypervolume measures are used to compare the results of the quality assessment of Pareto fronts. Simulation study on Gridsim ensures that the QGLBS approach works effectively for real life scenario with various workflow applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Random numbers are employed in the random initial weight distributions of dense and convolutional neural networks, in which results show a profound difference in learning patterns for the two.

In 50 convolutional neural networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), the MNIST and CIFAR-10 problems are benchmarked, and in MNIST the QRNG experiences a higher starting accuracy than the PRNG but ultimately only exceeds it by 0.02%.

Such systems with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problem of Qubit-Allocation (mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement (routing qubits from one location to another for entanglement) for NISQ machines. We observe that there can be variation in the error rates of different qubits and links, which can impact the decisions for qubit movement and qubit allocation. We analyze publicly available characterization data for the IBM-Q20 to quantify the variation and show that there is indeed significant variability in the error rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We show that the device variability has a significant impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links, and guide more operations towards the stronger qubits and links. Our evaluations, with a simulation-based model of IBM-Q20, show that Variation-Aware policies can improve the system reliability by up to 1.7x. We also evaluate our policies on the IBM-Q5 machine and demonstrate that our proposal significantly improves the reliability of real systems (up to 1.9X).",34,160,180,1,3,,,978-1-4503-6240-5,,2019,10.1145/3297858.3304007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3297858.3304007,13,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BQ3DR,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although there have been extensive works experimentally characterizing and analyzing CMOS transistors at similar to 4 K, there is a lack of digital and memory subsystem study. Since on-chip SRAM is one of the most power-consuming and the most vulnerable element in cryogenic SoC, this work analyzes the stability of low-voltage 6T-SRAM at deep cryogenic temperature (i.e 77K and 8K), in comparison with 300K operation. Our DC analysis showed that in general, Write static noise margins of the SRAM cell improves when temperature changes from 300K to 8K, even at low-voltage condition. Regarding the Read static noise margin, our simulation showed that the inverters exhibit pseudo-static hysteresis and interestingly this leads to an improvement of read static noise margin of the cell, similar to what observed in a Schmitt-Trigger SRAM.

To simultaneously accelerate simulation and enlarge the total memory space, we propose a heterogeneous parallelization approach by combining GPUs and CPUs. Our simulator allocates memory to the GPUs first, and then to the CPUs. It thus accelerates simulation by using the full capabilities of the GPUs if memory for the simulation fits in the GPUs on a cluster. Allocating memory to the CPUs reduces benefits of the GPUs but enlarges the capacity of qubits in the simulation.

Here, we consider a system with multiple IRS and users, with one user communicating via several IRSs. In such a system, the user to which an IRS is assigned for each unit time must be determined to realize efficient communication. The previous studies on the optimization of various parameters for IRS based wireless systems did not consider the optimization of such IRS allocation scheduling. Therefore, we propose an IRS allocation scheduling method that limits the number of users who allocate each IRS to one unit time and sets the reflection coefficients of the IRS specifically to the assigned user resulting in the maximum IRS array gain. Additionally, as the proposed method is a combinatorial optimization problem, we develop a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation to solve this using quantum computing. This will lead to the optimization of the entire system at a high speed and low power consumption in the future.

Orthogonal to existing QC simulation optimizations, we aim to accelerate the simulation by eliminating the redundant computation among those Monte Carlo simulation trials. We observe that the intermediate states of many trials can often be the same. Once these states are computed in one trial, they can be temporarily stored and reused in other trials. However, storing such states will consume significant memory space. To leverage the shared intermediate states without introducing too much storage overhead, we propose to statically generate and analyze the Monte Carlo simulation simulation trials before the actual simulation. Those trials are reordered to maximize the overlapped computation between two consecutive trials. The states that cannot be reused in follow-up simulation are dropped, so that we only need to store a few states. Experiment results show that the proposed optimization scheme can save on average 80% computation with only a small number of state vectors stored.

The method computes the order r of a random element x in the group Z(N)* and uses that information for splitting N with an application of the greatest common divisor algorithm. However, being probabilistic, the success of Shor's algorithm relies on some special properties of N. If r is even and x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N, then gcd(x(r/2) - 1, N) reveals a nontrivial factor of N and the method succeeds. But even assuming that r is even and being given the complete prime factorization of N it is not obvious whether x(r/2) not equivalent to -1 mod N and, therefore, it is not easy to assert whether Shor's algorithm would split N without running it and looking at its answer. We present a strategy for detecting whether the splitting occurs without any need for running the quantum order-finding algorithm, but we must be given the prime factorization of N. This has allowed us to produce the first direct evidence of the probability of success of Shor's method.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a dung beetle search algorithm (QHDBO) based on quantum computing and a multi-strategy hybrid. The good point set strategy is used to initialize the initial population of dung beetles . That makes the initial population more evenly distributed, and reduces the likelihood of the algorithm falling into a local optimum solution. The convergence factor and dynamic balance between the number of Spawning and foraging dung beetles is proposed. That allows the algorithm to focus on the global search in the early stages and local exploration in the later stages. The quantum computing based t-distribution variation strategy is used to variate the optimal global solution, that prevents the algorithm from falling into a local optimum.

We show that a direct discretization of the Schrodinger equation by central finite differences leads to a non-symmetric Hamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of such matrices is more complex it is advantageous to transform it in a symmetric form. This can be done by the Liouville-like transformation proposed by Rizea et al. (2008), which replaces the wave function psi(rho) with the function F(rho) = psi(rho)root rho and transforms the Hamiltonian accordingly. Even though a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is produced by this procedure, the computed wave functions are found to be inaccurate near the origin, and the accuracy of the energy levels is not very high. In order to improve on this, we devised a finite-difference scheme which discretizes the Schrodinger equation in the first step, and then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the difference equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix, resulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite element method. The superior efficiency of the new finite-difference scheme (FDM) is demonstrated for a few p-dependent one-dimensional potentials which are usually employed to model the electron states in free-standing and core shell quantum wires. The new scheme is compared with the other FDM schemes for solving the effective-mass Schrodinger equation, and is found to deliver energy levels with much smaller numerical error for all the analyzed potentials. It also gives more accurate results than the scheme of Rizea et al., except for the ground state of an infinite rectangular potential in freestanding quantum wires. Moreover, the PT symmetry is invoked to explain similarities and differences between the considered FDM schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This SaaS-like service, like its ancestors, should be strategically distributed and managed over multiple cloud zones, while taking into account several constraints and conditions (e.g., sensitivity of BPaaS fragments, insecure and untrusted cloud zones, lack of resources, and workload changes). However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which means that they are no longer suitable to manage such enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload. QGA-NN is evaluated using a BPaaS placement algorithm, which we defined as a triggered management operation.

In contrast, novel nanotechnologies like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) allow for computations with very low energy dissipation and hence are promising candidates for breaking this limit.

Molecules from the ISM gas-phase can be adsorbed at the grain surfaces, diffuse and react to give iCOMs and ultimately desorbed back to the gas phase. Thus, the study of the Binding Energy (BE) of these molecules at the water ice grain surface is important to understand the molecular composition of the ISM and its evolution in time. In this paper, we propose to use a recently developed semiempirical quantum approach, named GFN-xTB, and more precisely the GFN2 method, to compute the BE of several molecular species at the crystalline water ice slab model.

The relatively good results obtained confirm GFN2 as the method of choice to model adsorption processes occurring at the icy grains in the ISM.

The QM/MM scoring significantly improved the detection of correct zinc-binding geometries and improved the docking success rate by more than 20% for several important drug targets. The performance of both the classical and the QM/MM scoring functions compare favorably to the performance of AutoDock4, AutoDock4Zn, and AutoDock Vina.",90,49,54,2,47,1549-9596,1549-960X,,NOV,2014,10.1021/ci5004152,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci5004152,16,"Chemistry, Medicinal; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Chemistry; Computer Science,AU4AH,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

The principal structures studied are AA and AB (Bernal) stacked graphene bilayers, an 80C nanocone with pentagonal defects at its apex, and a 16C nanoring. Graphene and other based nanostructures have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic properties. For example, bilayer graphene shows superconductivity at certain magic angles of rotation. Open source molecular modeling and visualization programs like SAMSON, Avogadro, and VMD are utilized to generate the structures above. Using bond information in order to find nearest neighbors, an adjacency matrix can be generated from which the energy eigenvalues are solvable and are used to visualize the dispersion relation, free energy, persistent current, Green's function, and entanglement entropy. The goal of this project is to study the effect of rotation on the electronic properties of bilayer graphene, particularly as it pertains to the magic angle where superconductivity occurs, as well as the electronic properties of the bilayer Moire patterns which emerge due to the superposition of the identical lattices at different angles. An important goal is to incorporate phonon interactions into the tight-binding model for carbon structures, and to utilize quantum based computing as a tool to find the ground state properties of these structures, particularly in the terminating case where boundary conditions have an effect.",27,0,0,0,0,,,978-1-5386-7933-3,,2018,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BO6GY,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper compares the enhancement in information when filtering these noisy EEG signals while using a Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) based Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) model and a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering model, while investigating over multiple classification techniques on several datasets. The RQNN model is designed to efficiently capture the statistical behavior of the input signal using an unsupervised learning scheme. The algorithm is robust to parametric sensitivity and does not make any a priori assumption about the true signal type or the embedded noise. The performance of both the filtering approaches, investigated for the BCI competition IV 2b dataset as well as the offline datasets on subjects in the BCI laboratory, over multiple classifiers shows that the RQNN can potentially be a flexible technique that can suit different classifiers for real-time EEG signal filtering. The average classification accuracy performance across all the subjects with the RQNN technique is better than the SG (and the unfiltered signal) by approximately 5% (and 7%) and 1% (and 4%) during the training and the evaluation stages respectively.

The embedding was used to sample missing visible units and labels of incomplete test images. The previously introduced RBM embedding that combined qubits into individual RBM units in order to increase the connectivity between units was used. In comparison to the 1000 qubit machine investigated earlier, the same embedding approach applied to the 2000 qubit D-Wave enabled a connectivity between RBM units sufficient for RBM training on a classical computer with a satisfactory classification error. After a varied number of CD training iterations, the visible units corresponding to a particular incomplete test image were fixed in the D-Wave embedding. The resulting state returned by the D- Wave represents the most energetically favorable combination of the remaining qubits for the given fixed incomplete input image. The classification errors compared favorably to those obtained by the classical MCMC sampling. Main factors influencing the quality of the embedding were investigated. Regardless of the computational cost incentives for using the D-Wave for this operation, the reconstruction and classification errors determined in this way can be used at least as a verification of the validity and quality of the particular embedding of the given RBM architecture. This is essential for successfully employing a QC in much more computationally demanding parts of the RBM training. Opportunities for using QC not only for recognition but especially for RBM training, in particular for obtaining a representative sample from the RBM model distribution, are discussed.",21,1,1,0,0,2161-4393,,978-1-5090-6014-6,,2018,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Computer Science; Engineering,BQ3NO,,2024-03-12,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to overcome the problem of limited interconnectivity in the D-Wave architecture, the proposed RBM embedding combines multiple qubits to represent a particular RBM unit. The results for the lowest-energy (the ground state) and some of the higher-energy states found by the D-Wave 2X were compared with those of the classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. In many cases, the D-Wave machine successfully found the same RBM lowest-energy state as that found by SA. In some examples, the D-Wave machine returned a state corresponding to one of the higher-energy local minima found by SA. The inherently nonperfect embedding of the RBM into the Chimera lattice explored in this work (i.e., multiple qubits combined into a single RBM unit were found not to be guaranteed to be all aligned) and the existence of small, persistent biases in the D-Wave hardware may cause a discrepancy between the D-Wave and the SA results. In some of the investigated cases, introduction of a small bias field into the energy function or optimization of the chain-strength parameter in the D-Wave embedding successfully addressed difficulties of the particular RBM embedding.

This enzyme plays an important role in the microbial degradation of oil, chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuel additives, and many other compounds. A number of these enzymes has been biochemically characterized in detail because the potential of alkane hydroxylases to catalyse high added-value reactions is widely recognized. Nevertheless, the industrial and process bioremediation application of them is restricted, owing to their complex biochemistry, challenging process requirements, and the limited number of their three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, AlkB has great potential as biocatalysts for selective transformation of a wide range of chemically inert unreactive alkanes into reactive chemical precursors that can be used as tools for bioremediation and bioprocesses. Aiming to understand the possible ways the AlkB enzyme Pseudomonas putida P1 interacts with octane, octanol and 1-octyne, we consider its suitable biochemical structure taking into account a 3-D homology modelling.
